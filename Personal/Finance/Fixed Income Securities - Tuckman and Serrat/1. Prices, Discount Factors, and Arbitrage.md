## 1.1 - Government Coupon Bonds
#coupon
Discounting can rightly be used and regarded as shorthand for arbitrage pricing.
"$1 mm face of  these 2.5s of 05/15/2024" - Bond with coupon rate of 2.5% maturity on may 15, 2024.
- Treasury promises to make half the bond's annual coupon rate every six months and the principal payment at maturity
- Bond prices are quoted per 100 face amount
## 1.2 - Discount Factors
#discountfactor
Discount factor is the present value of one unit of currency to be received at the end of that term.
Discount factor $d(t)$ represents the time value of money
$$
101.4297 = \left( 100+\frac{2.875}{2} \right)d(0.5)
$$
For a bond maturing in 6 months and a $2.875$% coupon.

## 1.3 - The Law of One Price
**Law of One Price** - absent confounding factors (liquidity, financing, taxes, credit risk), identical cash flows should sell for the same price.
- Prices of other bonds can be either rich or cheap relative to whatever discount factors you calculate them off of.

Older (illiquid), high-coupon bonds historically trade cheap relative to other bonds. They may trade rich because some investors with a strong preference for income are willing to pay more than fair value for bonds paying high coupons.
## 1.4 - Arbitrage and the Law of One Price
Law of one price is enforced by arbitrage activity.

*Replicating Portfolio* Example - sell a rich 7.625s of 11/15/2022 and buy a portfolio of bonds which perfectly replicates the cash flows of the short sell.

Cash flows on the three payment dates are equal to the short bond, and the arbitrageur receives 12 cents today without incurring any future obligations.
- Cost of purchasing 2/94454 face amount of the 2.125s of 05/15/2022 at a price of 102.0662 is 2.94454% $\times$ 102.0662 = 3.00538
### A1.1

- The total cost of the replicating portfolio exactly equals the present value of the bond computed through the law of one price.
- In reality, market costs, transaction costs, and idiosyncratic characteristics of bonds may price differently
## 1.5 - Application: Idiosyncratic Pricing of Treasury STRIPS
STRIPS - zero coupon bond
- Created when a particular coupon bond is delivered to the treasury in exchange for claims on its future coupon and principal components.
- STRIPS received in exchange for coupon payments are called TINTs, INTS, or C-SRIPS
- STRIPS received in exchange for principal payments are called TPs, Ps, or P-STRIPS.
Upon delivery of all the STRIPS, the treasury would reconstitute the $1,000,000 face amount of the bond.
- C-STRIPS are fungible while P-STRIPS are not.
    - C-STRIPS maturing on a particular date may be applied toward the coupon payment of that bond on that date
    - P-STRIPS that were stripped form a particular bond may be used to reconstitute the principal payment of that bond.
This implies that P-STRIPS, and not C-STRIPS are likely to inherit the cheapness or richness of the bonds from which they are stripped.

If the price of C-STRIPS is 85.9453 per 100 face amount, the implied discount factor is 0.859453
