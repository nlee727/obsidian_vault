## 0.1 - Global Fixed Income Markets
#international
March 2021, global notional for outstanding debt securities is $123 Tn, while the capitalization of global equity markets was $110 Tn.
- US, Eurozone, China, Japan and UK comprise nearly 90% of total issuers of debt.
    - The large fraction of government debt in Japan reflect decades of government borrowing and spending to stimulate their economy.
    - US, Euro, and UK participation has increased significantly since 2007-2009.
    - US corporations are more likely to issue bonds to the public, while corporations outside the US borrow from intermediaries which raise money from the public.
    
## 0.2 - US Markets
Total outstanding is $76 Tn
- $24.3 Tn Treasuries
- $17.3 Tn Mortgages
- $14.7 Tn Corporate and Foreign Bonds
- $9.0 Tn Loans and Advances
- $4.3 Tn Consumer Credit
- $4.0 Tn Municipal Securities
- $1.8 Tn Agency/GSE Debt
### Treasuries
#treasuries
Grown from the 3rd largest behind mortgages and corporate and foreign bonds to the largest in less than a decade.

The government can fund its deficit spending with T-bills (discount securities), Treasury notes and bonds (coupon securities). Notes are issues with 10 or fewer years to maturity while bonds are more than 10 years.
- Historically, bonds were subject to a maximum, statutory rate of interest but today they are used interchangeably
#### Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)
#TIPS
Protect investors against inflation with principal amount that depend on CPI.
- Earn a fixed real/inflation-adjusted return while coupon-bearing Treasuries (nominal bonds) earn a nominal/dollar return.
Only 5.6% of the total but have large importance measuring market's perception of inflation and price of inflation risk. 
- Say nominal bonds 2.8% higher than TIPS for the same maturity. Then markets expect average inflation of 2.8% over the subsequent maturity.
- Can also say that given expected inflation and risk, investors require a 2.8% premium to buy nominal bonds and to assume inflation over that maturity.
#### Floating-rate notes (FRN)
#FRN
2% of the market in total. Relatively new, first issued in Jan 2014. Sold with 2 years to maturity with a variable rate of interest equal to the going rate on 13-week T-bills + a fixed spread.
- The spread entices some investors who might otherwise roll investments of short-term T-bills to sacrifice some liquidity and buy two-year FRNs instead.
- For the treasury, it locks in funding for 2 years but at a cost only slightly above that of short-term bills (less than 5 basis points in 2021)
- FRNs seem to cost less than 2 year notes because government accounting of interest rate cost does not penalize risk of rates increasing in the future.
#### Auction Schedule
The auction schedule is set by the treasury to let investors know in advance which securities will be sold when and in what quantities. It is modulated to suit both the borrowing needs of government and changing market conditions
- The most recently issued bonds of each type and maturity tend to be the ones most actively traded.
    - The just issued notes are called x-year on-the-run notes, and are likely to be the most actively traded, while the next will be the old notes, double-old notes, triple-old notes, etc.
### Nonmarketable securities
- Savings bonds - discount securities sold directly to individual investors
- State and Local Government Series bonds (SLUGs)
##### Government Accounts
Also nonmarketable and represent the debt that the government owes itself, for example social security trust funds. It is argued that these bonds to not represent any additional treasury indebtedness and excluded from most descriptions of government indebtedness (Total debt held by the public).

Debt held by public is usually normalized by GDP, since countries with greater GDPs can safely carry greater levels of debt. 
- Debt to GDP is 100%, higher than 100% during WW2 and COVID, 80% during financial crisis.
- 230% in Japan, 175% in Greece, 100% in France, 85% in the UK
Foreign investors still find US treasuries attractive despite high ratio of US debt to GDP
### Municipal Securities
#municipal
More than 50,000 issuers and ~1,000,000 individual bond issues, issued by states and local government to fund their expenditures. Dominated by retail investors (over 70%) and indirectly by individuals through mutual funds and other investment vehicles.
- As long as funds raised are used for public projects, payments are exempt from federal tax
- Capital gains on price appreciation from munis is not exempt, so the market has evolved to minimize the proportion of return in the form of taxed price appreciation rather than untaxed interest.
- In a low-rate environment munis have a 5% coupon and consequently at a premium to par. They are therefore unlikely to trade at a discount and subject buy and hold purchasers to taxes on capital gains.
- Depends on the state if bonds are taxed in other states and exempt their own bonds. DC does not tax any while Utah exempts munis issues in states that exempt Utah's bonds (states with no income tax automatically qualify).
$500 bn of munis that don't qualify are used for working capital, funding private business development, refinancing existing debt. These pay rates comparable to corporate and Treasury markets controlling for difference in credit quality.
#### 3 Broad Categories
- General Obligation (GO) bonds - 25% of the market, backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality
- Revenue Bonds - 66%, backed by revenues from particular projects like tolls from a highway
    - Industrial revenue bonds $600 bn subset of tax exempt debt for private enterprises engaged in qualifying projects.
- Prefunded/defeased bonds - canceled as a municipal liability. Cash and Treasury securities are set aside to fund the remaining payment obligations (credit risk improved to that of treasuries).
#### Default risk
Much lower than the equivalent corporate bonds (0.08% from 1970-2020). GO bonds were considered safer than revenue bonds until Detroit went bankrupt in 2013. Holders of water and sewer bonds suffered no loss of principal while GO bonds suffered significant losses.
- GO bonds are now treated like unsecured claims.
- **Before 2008, majority of muni bonds were insured against default for a fee by private insurers. These insurers suffered but from having insured MBS during 2008. The damage to the industry resulted in less than 5% of muni issues being insured, now the number is around 10%**
### Other US Markets
#### Mortgages
Loans used to purchase properties and collateralized by those same properties. Only about 45% of loan balances are help by the original lenders. The rest are securitized.
#### Corporate and Foreign Bonds
Bonds sold by US nonfinancial corporations (45%), US financial corporations (31%), foreign corporations to US investors (24%) to raise money to fund operations and corporate transactions. 
#### Loans and Advances
Half are made by banks, the rest by an assortment of financial and nonfinancial entities. Securitization and trading of bank loans here.
#### Agency/GSE Debt
#agency #gse
Issuing entities span a range of associations with the federal government, with varying levels of support.
- Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Small Business Administration (SBA), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) debt issues backed fully by the government.
- Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) provides electricity for local power companies is a federal agency (formally owned by the US government), and backed by its own revenue not the government.
- Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) are GSEs but owned by private shareholders, following 2008 are under government conservatorship.
    - Leading up to 2008, they were not explicitly backed by the government but market expectations for full support were realized during and after the crisis.
#### Commercial Paper
Highly rated corporations borrow short-term funds from the public.
## 0.3 - US Market Participants
Foreign entities invest $14 Tn in US debt securities on their own or as intermediaries. 

On the liability side, fed borrows $24.3 Tn, munis borrow $3.2 Tn, Households $17.3 Tn, Nonfinancial businesses $18 Tn, remaining borrow as intermediaries. The rest of the world borrows $4.9 Tn through US debt securities and loans.
### Households
#households
The sector has significant net worth (assets exceed financial liabilities). 
- Mostly equity and debt markets, however a greater fraction is invested through intermediaries (pensions, mutual funds, life insurance)
- Large fraction in cash equivalents (deposits/ money market funds)
- For liabilities, households borrow mostly through mortgages or consumer credit (home equity, auto, credit card, student)
![[Pasted image 20250422123610.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250422123749.png]]
- Decline in student loan delinquencies in 2020 is because of federal COVID forbearance programs.
### Nonfinancial Business
- Corporate businesses have established creditworthiness and broader access to markets as opposed to noncorporate (larger liabilities)
    - They can sell debt securities to raise 30% of their liabilities while noncorporate sell essentially none.
- Noncorporate rely mostly on mortgages, and the differences in liability structures reflect the life cycle of business borrowings
    - Family and friends $\rightarrow$ bank loans $\rightarrow$ investor groups $\rightarrow$ private placements of debt $\rightarrow$ public debt securities.
### Commercial Banks
#commercialbanks
Banks accept deposits, pay interest, offer customers safety through deposit insurance and liquidity for checkable deposit. Deposits (not debt securities/loans) constituted 93% of commercial bank liabilities.
- Other liabilities - bank's parent company investments, long term debt, commercial paper, assorted loans, repo
- Assets - C&I loans, real estate loans, consumer loans
    - Banks also hold liquid assets, cash, reserves, deposits at the fed, other MM instruments
    - Also hold treasuries, agency securities, and MBS to earn higher rates of return
Commercial bank assets are highly concentrated. 4,000 banks in the US but $12.5 Tn of the $19 Tn are held by the largest 25 banks.
- Number of banks in the country has been declining gradually but swiftly (likely an adjustment from historical restrictions on interstate banking and branching that prevented larger banks from satisfying market demand)
- Smaller banks hold much more in real estate loans (often local)
### Life Insurance Companies
#lifeinsurance
Primarily savings vehicles where policy holder invest funds for tax deferral. They are financial intermediaries that collect and invest premiums to meet their obligations under sold policies and earn additional returns for shareholders.
- Long-term fixed income assets are natural hedges to the long-term nature of their policy liabilities.
- Asset portfolios contain large fractions of corporate bonds and equities (36.4% and 8.5%), 18.8% in mutual funds shares.
- Corporate bond investments make them significant players in that market (24% of total market)
- Treasuries are theoretically useful as a match for long-term liabilities but do not earn enough, only make up 2.4% of assets.
- Also use derivatives to achieve their return and hedging objectives.
### Pension Funds
#pensionfunds
Previously defined benefit (DB) plans, where the sponsor promises to pay retirees according to a formula (risk resides with the sponsor). Now, defined contribution (DC) plans are more important, where the employee chooses among a few investment options (risk resides with employees).
Government employees are federal, state, and local levels always have DB plans or option to participate in DB. Private sector have been migrating from DB to DC plans
- Corporations are actively shedding DB pension fund risk through pension risk transfer transactions (insurance companies assume pension liabilities).
- Long-term debt instrument naturally hedge PV of fixed liabilities for a DB PM.
- Allocations to equities hold out the prospect of having to make smaller contributions to the fund.
    - The largest 100DB plans in 2020 - 50% fixed income, 32% equity, 18% in other (real estate, PE, HF)
### Money Market Funds
#moneymarket
Created in 1970s, designed to offer safety/immediacy while paying higher rates than banks were allowed to pay on deposits.
3 broad categories
1. Government Funds- Purchase only short-term government-backed debt
2. Prime Funds - Invest predominantly in short-term, high-quality corporate debt like commercial paper
3. Tax Exempt Funds - Invest in short-term, high-quality, tax-exempt municipal debt.
Before 2008, investors buy a share for $1 and could sell at any time for $1. 
- If a fund complies by SEC rules (2a-7)
- NAV corresponding to a value per share between 99.5c and $1.005 offer and redeem shares at a stable NAV of $1 per share. If it falls below, the fund "breaks the buck" and redeemed at the fund's NAV, making them similar to bank deposits but without government guarantee.
During 2008, money market fund investors withdrew huge volumes of cash from prime funds and deposited into government funds. Fearing flight from prime money market funds would make things worse, treasury instituted a program where it guaranteed money market fund shares for one year.
- Fed created a facility that extended nonrecourse loans to banks collateralized by asset-backed CP bought from money market funds

After the crisis, 2a-7 were tightened, institutional prime and tax-exempt MM funds as opposed to funds with only retail investors, must allow share price to float with the fund's NAV.
- Proponents argue floating NAV raise awareness that fund values can fluctuate and discourage withdrawals timed to precede a fund breaking the buck
- Opponents argues MM investors are well aware of risks, floating NAV have little bearing on flights to safety away from prime funds. Instead it increases accounting, operational, tax, legal complexities of using MM funds.
The third change was that prime and tax-exempt MM funds had to have the power under various stress conditions to impose redemption fees up to 2% and gates that prevent withdrawals for up to 10 business days in any 90-day period.
- Redemption fees are paid to the fund and intended to discourage investor withdrawals in a crisis and recover losses from liquidating assets in a crisis to meet those withdrawals. 
- Gates intended to give funds a grace period to manage under stressed market conditions (if it cannot restore stability it is liquidated)
    - Government funds may choose to include the power to impose fees and gates. May encourage earlier, preemptive redemptions

In 2020, balances in government mm funds increased markedly. Institutional prime fund balances stayed at $600 bn, retail fell from $500 bn to $200 bn.
- Prime balances fell dramatically, however in March 2020 and institutional balances fell more than retail balances.
- Federal Reserve supported MM and balances recovered quickly. Possibility of redemption fees and gates in March 2020 encouraged preemptive withdrawals by prime investors and sales of assets by prime fund managers, who raised liquidity to avoid triggering fees and gates
- SEC is revisiting fees and gates and considering other changes to regulation of institutional prime funds.
## 0.4 - Monetary Policy with Abundant Reserves
#monetarypolicy
Creation and maintenance of national currency achieved by purchasing government bonds with that currency. Currency of US is made of green bills "Federal Reserve Notes" (liabilities of Fed). Currency backed by government bonds.
- Outstanding currency is a liability
- Treasury securities are assets
Second role of the central bank is to provide liquidity to banks under short-term distress (since banks will often find themselves solvent but illiquid).
- Banks can borrow from Fed through the discount window on any acceptable collateral.
The third role is to "maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates ... so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates"
- Fed is said to have a "Duel Mandate" of full employment and low inflation.
###### Two Points
1. Banks are required to maintain cash and reserves, which are deposits held at a Federal Reserve (interest bearing)
2. The Fed sets the reserves in the banking system. Add reserves through security purchase, lending through repo (loan asset added to fed balance sheet).
Before 2008, banks traded in the interbank fed funds market. If the fed wanted to ease monetary conditions it would use an open market purchase (given growth low and inflation not a threat), it would add reserves to the banking system, decreasing fed funds rate and increase volume of bank loans.
#quantitativeeasing
Quantitative Easing - when interest rates are nearly zero and to stimulate the economy further by purchasing US Treasuries and agency MBS
- QE has increased the size of Fed's balance sheet (9x) but also changed the way approaching monetary policy.
For administrative rates, the interest on reserve balances (IORB) and reverse repo facility (RRP). The fed sets a rate range for fed funds rate; it sets the IORB to determine the rate which banks are willing, it sets the RRP rate as the floor to the rate at which money market funds and other will lend.
- Fed instituted standing repo facility (SRF) as a response to the events in Sep 2019 and March 2020, where primary dealers and bank counterparties can borrow money overnight from the fed.
#### Policy Issues
Fed was established and traditionally accepted deposits only from banks (private banking sector responsible for capital allocation decisions).
- Purchase of Treasuries and MBS are capital allocation decisions and currency has fallen to 26% of fed liabilities
- Acceptance by Fed of large deposits from public through RRP has disintermediated banks.
    - RRP may encourage public, in a crisis, to withdraw funds from the bank and buy MM shares to be deposited in RRP
- Maintaining a large balance sheet during normal times limit room for action in future times of stress
- Fed is paying interest on their reserves, cost to taxpayers when for example - the treasury borrows through 3 month T bills and the fed is investing some of its assets in those same T bills at 5/6 basis points while the fed is borrowing from banks through reserves at 15 bp. Could be a bigger issue when IORB is increased.
    - Treasury has been keeping more of its cash balances or deposits at the fed to avoid the situation in which treasury holds stores of cash as deposits at banks, earning a low rate of interest while the banks are depositing those fund at the Fed and earning IORB.
## 0.5 - Negative Rates and QE in Europe and Japan
### Reasons to use negative rates
1. If bank deposit rates are negative, then purchasing a bond yielding a less negative rate would be preferable.
2. If the future is characterized by deflation, a negative yielding bond can offer a positive real return.
3. In short term trading, negative yielding bonds increase in price if yields fall
European Central Bank (ECB) negative rates and QE 2014, Bank of Japan 2016
### Eurosystem (ECB)
#ecb
Collection of national central banks in the euro area. Individuals keep reserves at their central banks which interact with the ECB.
- Targets rates by setting a deposit facility rate and main refinancing operations (banks pay to borrow from the ECB through short-term repo transactions)
Set deposit facility rate at -0.5% and main refinancing to 0% in 2019.
- An individual can avoid the negative rate by lending out its reserves, but the system as a whole can not reduce the amount of reserves supplied by ECB to avoid the rate.
    - Extended periods of negative rates seem to have reduced bank profitability and lending activity
ECB turned to loans and QE to ease monetary conditions beyond reducing rates
#### Loans
- Before 2008, ECO loaned money to banks on a collateralized basis for a week through its main refinancing operations (MRO) and for 3 months through longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs).
    - Logic was banks have more flexibility to expand lending if they are more certain of their source of funds.
- In 2014, ECB began targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) - 4 year loans to banks in amounts based on how much banks loaned to their customers.
#### QE
European law prevents ECB from funding individual governments, so ECB has aimed to purchase bonds of national governments in proportions to their capital keys - which reflect sizes of their populations and economies.
- ECB is expected to own more than 40% of all German and 40% of all Italian government bonds outstanding.
Recent large scale issuance of debt by European Commission has made QE easier for ECB. EC debt is an obligation of EU as a whole.
- EC issuing 100 billion pounds of SURE (Temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) bonds and 800 billion of NextGenerationEU bonds to finance COVID recovery.
- For the ECB, debt issues of the EC provide more eligible bonds for purchase and bonds that are not subject to cross-country puchase allocation contraints.
- EC debt do face other constrains: currently, ECB can invest at most 10% in supranational debt and can hold no more than 50% of the debt of any one supranational debt
### Bank of Japan 
#boj
BOJ had already pushed Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONAR) and interbank to nearly zero in 2001, and introduced QE by purchasing Japanese government bonds w/ maturities longer than 2 years. Did not increase substantially until 2013.
- Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) commited long-term JGB, corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds, equities, lowering yields on long-term JBG.
- By 2016 BOJ went negative, lowering to -0.1%.
- Began yield curve control/targeting, where it committed to buy/sell 10-year JGB to keep yields at 0% (BOJ did not have to purchase great volume of bonds to keep rates low since the mere threat of central bank trading to keep yields at 0% is enough to keep market at that level.
- Continued low inflation in Japan are keeping BOJ committed to expansionary policies.
## 0.6 - Trading and Liquidity
### Liquidity
#liquidity
- Bid-ask spread - customer can conceive of the cost of trading as half the bid-ask spread
- Volume and turnover - measured as an absolute amount and percentage of total outstanding amount of that security.
    - Would be easy to sell $1 mm of a bonds when ADV is $500 mm, but hard to sell 10% of a bond issue when its daily turnover is 2%.
- Market depth - measurement of liquidity used in connection with a central limit order book (CLOB). Defined as the sum of volumes of limit orders placed at prices from mid to some level above or below mid.
- Price impact/Implementation shortfall - extent to which market price can be expected to change as a result of a large transaction, implementation shortfall measures the difference between realized purchase/sale relative to market price before the transaction. Traders and dealers will use models from past transactions to quote prices at which they are willing to guarantee execution of large orders.
#### ADV of Trading in Fixed income 2021 Q4
- Treasuries 650 bn
    - Most recently issued bonds most liquid
- Agency MBS 251 bn
- Corporates 34.5
    - Varies with age, credit quality, issue size
    - Also most recently issued (turnover 45% in first month of issuance to 13.5% in the second etc)
- Munis 8.9
    - Varies with issuance like corporates
- Agencies 2.4
- ABS 1.3
- Non-Agency MBS 1
### Electronification
Dealer-to-customer (D2C) trades take place on single-dealer or multi-dealer platforms mostly through RFQ.
- A customer requests price quotes to trade a particular size of a security or portfolio of securities. 
Direct streams are also used, where dealers continuously send prices. 
Dealer-to-dealer (D2D) trades take place in interdealer electronic platforms, usually though CLOB. Traders submit limit orders with other dealers.
- Principal trading firms (PTF) more important and participate directly on interdealer platforms and set up direct streams from individual dealers.
In the treasury market from Feb 2019 to May 2020, 65% of all trades were electronic (33% D2D, 67% DTC of which 48% were electronic. The electronic trades were 54% CLOB, 33% RFQ, 13% streaming)
### Dealer Regulation and Risk Taking
#risk
Market Risk - dealer holding an inventory of corporate bonds can easily hedge rate changes or credit spread changes, but hedging the unique credit risk of individual bonds can be difficult and expensive.
Execution Risk - a dealer must typically work out of a large position, as selling a block will wipe out the spread the dealer charged the customer, so he will chunk out.
- Risks other market participants jumping in to sell the same security at the same time and idiosyncratic market risks of the position.
After 2008, there was more stringent regulation for dealers in banking entities (Volcker rule)
- As a result, banking entities are less willing to hold securities inventory and make markets. Primary dealers are holding much smaller net positions in bonds while the total amount of bonds outstanding has increased dramatically.
### Growth of PTFs
Reduction of dealer market making made up by PTFs. Mostly electronic, advancement of electronification is due to demand from PTFs. 
- 2015, inadvertent leak of top 10 firms by trading volume on Treasuries, only 2 were banks. PTFs and dealers comprised 48% of trading in interdealer broker market.
### Growth of ETFs
Authorized Participants (APs) of an ETF can create ETF shares by buying underlying assets, adding them to the fund's portfolio, and selling ETF shares against those additional assets.
- APs can also reduce the number of outstanding ETF shares by taking assets from the underlying portfolio, selling them, and purchasing existing ETF shares corresponding to the sold assets.
Regular investors cannot exchange their shares for securities in the underlying portfolio or deliver securities in exchange for new ETF shares.
- Motivation for bond ETFs is the creation of liquid trading vehicles from relatively illiquid assets (aging bonds).
- Market for trading portfolios comprising bonds that are all or mostly all held by ETFs emerging.
Much more liquid
- Example: ETF hold only 4.8% of high-yield corporate bonds outstanding, but ADV of these ETFs comprise 24.3% of ADV of all bonds.
- ETF prices traded at significant discount from NAV as bond prices plummeted and vice versa.
- Investors could sell their bonds most efficiently by first exchanging them into ETFs (giving to APs)
### Growing Concentration of Asset Managers
AUM at top 20 global managers were 29% in 1995, 28% in 2000, and 43% in 2020. Increasing concentration in asset management implies growing demand in the market for larger trades $\iff$ growing amount of execution risk 
### Summary
Dealers allocating less risk to market making, asset managers need to execute large trades. Dealers thus focus on largest and best clients while others are pushed to electronic platforms. PTFs makes up for the loss of liquidity by providing frequent liquidity on small trades rather than assuming execution risk of larger orders.
- Liquidity plentiful for small trades in electronic markets
- Liquidity challenging for larger trades
- Customers bear execution risk of their own trades instead of paying dealers to assume the risk. Liquidity regime that shifting executing risk to the buy side.
### Liquidity and Fragility
Some believe liquidity provision by PTFs is less stable than dealers (PTF will shut down in stress while dealers will continue for their business relationships).
#### Flash Rally October 15 2014
Large move on treasury yields in 12 minutes. Trading volume increased dramatically and market depth dropped precipitously.
- PTFs reacted primarily by reducing limit order quantities while bank-dealers reacted by widening bid-ask spreads and briefly removing their offers to sell securities.
