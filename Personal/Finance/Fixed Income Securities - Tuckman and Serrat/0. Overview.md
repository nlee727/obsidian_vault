### Treasuries
#treasuries
Grown from the 3rd largest behind mortgages and corporate and foreign bonds to the largest in less than a decade.

The government can fund its deficit spending with T-bills (discount securities), Treasury notes and bonds (coupon securities). Notes are issues with 10 or fewer years to maturity while bonds are more than 10 years.
- Historically, bonds were subject to a maximum, statutory rate of interest but today they are used interchangeably
#### Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)
#TIPS
rotect investors against inflation with principal amount that depend on CPI.
- Earn a fixed real/inflation-adjusted return while coupon-bearing Treasuries (nominal bonds) earn a nominal/dollar return.
Only 5.6% of the total but have large importance measuring market's perception of inflation and price of inflation risk. 
- Say nominal bonds 2.8% higher than TIPS for the same maturity. Then markets expect average inflation of 2.8% over the subsequent maturity.
- Can also say that given expected inflation and risk, investors require a 2.8% premium to buy nominal bonds and to assume inflation over that maturity.
#### Floating-rate notes (FRN)
#FRN
2% of the market in total. Relatively new, first issued in Jan 2014. Sold with 2 years to maturity with a variable rate of interest equal to the going rate on 13-week T-bills + a fixed spread.
- The spread entices some investors who might otherwise roll investments of short-term T-bills to sacrifice some liquidity and buy two-year FRNs instead.
- For the treasury, it locks in funding for 2 years but at a cost only slightly above that of short-term bills (less than 5 basis points in 2021)
- FRNs seem to cost less than 2 year notes because government accounting of interest rate cost does not penalize risk of rates increasing in the future.
#### Auction Schedule
The auction schedule is set by the treasury to let investors know in advance which securities will be sold when and in what quantities. It is modulated to suit both the borrowing needs of government and changing market conditions
- The most recently issued bonds of each type and maturity tend to be the ones most actively traded.
    - The just issued notes are called x-year on-the-run notes, and are likely to be the most actively traded, while the august will be the old notes, double-old notes, triple-old notes, etc.
#### Nonmarketable securities
- Savings bonds - discount securities sold directly to individual investors
- State and Local Government Series bonds (SLUGs)
##### Government Accounts
Also nonmarketable and represent the debt that the government owes itself, for example social security trust funds. It is argues that these bonds to not represent any additional treasury indebtedness and excluded from most descriptions of government indebtedness (Total debt held by the public)

Debt held by public is usually normalized by GDP, since countries with greater GDPs can safely carry greater levels of debt. 
- Debt to GDP is 100%, higher than 100% during WW2 and COVID, 80% during financial crisis.
- 230% in Japan, 175% in Greece, 100% in France, 85% in the UK
Foreign investors still find US treasuries attractive despite high ratio of US debt to GDP
### Municipal Securities
#municipal
More than 50,000 issuers and ~1,000,000 individual bond issues, issued by states and local government to fund their expenditures. Dominated by retail investors (over 70%) and indirectly by individuals through mutual funds and other investment vehicles.
- As long as funds raised are used for public projects, payments are exempt from federal tax
- Capital gains on price appreciation from munis is not exempt, so the market has evolved to minimize the proportion of return in the form of taxed price appreciation rather than untaxed interest.
- In a low-rate environment munis have a 5% coupon and consequently at a premium to par. They are therefore unlikely to trade at a discount and subject buy and hold purchasers to taxes on capital gains.
- Depends on the state if bonds are taxed in other states and exempt their own bonds. DC does not tax any while Utah exempts munis issues in states that exempt Utah's bonds (states with no income tax automatically qualify).
$500 bn of munis that don't qualify are used for working capital, funding private business development, refinancing existing debt. These pay rates comparable to corporate and Treasury markets controlling for difference in credit quality.
#### 3 Broad Categories
- General Obligation (GO) bonds - 25% of the market, backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality
- Revenue Bonds - 66%, backed by revenues from particular projects like tolls from a highway
    - Industrial revenue bonds $600 bn subset of tax exempt debt for private enterprises engaged in qualifying projects.
- Prefunded/defeased bonds - canceled as a municipal liability. Cash and Treasury securities are set aside to fund the remaining payment obligations (credit risk improved to that of treasuries).
#### Default risk
Much lower than the equivalent corporate bonds (0.08% from 1970-2020). GO bonds were considered safer than revenue bonds until Detroit went bankrupt in 2013. Holders of water and sewer bonds suffered no loss of principal while GO bonds suffered significant losses.
- GO bonds are now treated like unsecured claims.
- **Before 2008, majority of muni bonds were insured against default for a fee by private insurers. These insurers suffered but from having insured MBS during 2008. The damage to the industry resulted in less than 5% of muni issues being insured, now the number is around 10%**
### Other US Markets
#### Mortgages
Loans used to purchase properties and collateralized by those same properties. Only about 45% of loan balances are help by the original lenders. The rest are securitized.
#### Corporate and Foreign Bonds
Bonds sold by US nonfinancial corporations (45%), US financial corporations (31%), foreign corporations to US investors (24%) to raise money to fund operations and corporate transactions. 
#### Loans and Advances
Half are made by banks, the rest by an assortment of financial and nonfinancial entities. Securitization and trading of bank loans here.
#### Agency/GSE Debt
Issuing entities span a range of associations with the federal government, with varying levels of support.
- Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Small Business Administration (SBA), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) debt issues backed fully by the government.
- Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) provides electricity for local power companies is a federal agency (formally owned by the US government), and backed by its own revenue not the government.
- Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) are GSEs but owned by private shareholders, following 2008 are under government conservatorship.
    - Leading up to 2008, they were not explicitly backed by the government but market expectations for full support were realized during and after the crisis.
#### Commercial Paper
Highly rated corporations borrow short-term funds from the public.
## 0.3 - US Market Participants
Foreign entities invest $14 Tn in US debt securities on their own or as intermediaries. 

On the liability side, fed borrows $24.3 Tn, munis borrow $3.2 Tn, Households $17.3 Tn, Nonfinancial businesses $18 Tn, remaining borrow as intermediaries. The rest of the world borrows $4.9 Tn through US debt securities and loans.
### Households
The sector has significant net worth (assets exceed financial liabilities). 
- Equity and debt markets, however a greater fraction is invested through intermediaries (pensions, mutual funds, life insurance)
- Large fraction in cash equivalents (deposits/ money market funds)
- For liabilities, households borrow mostly through mortgages or consumer credit (home equity, auto, credit card, student)

- Decline in student loan delinquencies in 2020 is because of federal COVID forbearance programs.
### Nonfinancial Business
- Corporate businesses have established creditworthiness and broader access to markets as opposed to noncorporate (larger liabilities)
    - They can sell debt securities to raise 30% of their liabilities while noncorporate sell essentially none.
- Noncorporate rely mostly on mortgages, and the differences in liability structures reflect the life cycle of business borrowings
    - Family and friends -> bank loans -> investor groups -> private placements of debt -> public debt securities.
### Commercial Banks
Banks accept deposits, pay interest, offer customers safety through deposit insurance and liquidity for checkable deposit. Deposits (not debt securities/loans) constituted 93% of commercial bank liabilities.
- Other liabilities - bank's parent company investments, long term debt, commercial paper, assorted loans, repo
- Assets - C&I loans, real estate loans, consumer loans
    - Banks also hold liquid assets, cash, reserves, deposits at the fed, other MM instruments
    - Also hold treasuries, agency securities, and MBS to earn higher rates of return
Commercial bank assets are highly concentrated. 4,000 banks in the US but $12.5 Tn of the $19 Tn are held by the largest 25 banks.
- Number of banks in the country has been declining gradually but swiftly (likely an adjustment from historical restrictions on interstate banking and branching that prevented larger banks from satisfying market demand)
- Smaller banks hold much more in real estate loans (often local)
