## 0.1 - Global Fixed Income Markets
#international
March 2021, global notional for outstanding debt securities is $123 Tn, while the capitalization of global equity markets was $110 Tn.
- US, Eurozone, China, Japan and UK comprise nearly 90% of total issuers of debt.
    - The large fraction of government debt in Japan reflect decades of government borrowing and spending to stimulate their economy.
    - US, Euro, and UK has increased significantly since 2007-2009.
    - US corporations are more likely to issue bonds to the public, while corporations outside the US borrow from intermediaries which raise money from the public.
    
## 0.2 - US Markets
Total outstanding is $76 Tn
- $24.3 Tn Treasuries
- $17.3 Tn Mortgages
- $14.7 Tn Corporate and Foreign Bonds
- $9.0 Tn Loans and Advances
- $4.3 Tn Consumer Credit
- $4.0 Tn Municipal Securities
- $1.8 Tn Agency/GSE Debt
### Treasuries
#treasuries
Grown from the 3rd largest behind mortgages and corporate and foreign bonds to the largest in less than a decade.

The government can fund its deficit spending with T-bills (discount securities), Treasury notes and bonds (coupon securities). Notes are issues with 10 or fewer years to maturity while bonds are more than 10 years.
- Historically, bonds were subject to a maximum, statutory rate of interest but today they are used interchangeably
#### Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)
#TIPS
rotect investors against inflation with principal amount that depend on CPI.
- Earn a fixed real/inflation-adjusted return while coupon-bearing Treasuries (nominal bonds) earn a nominal/dollar return.
Only 5.6% of the total but have large importance measuring market's perception of inflation and price of inflation risk. 
- Say nominal bonds 2.8% higher than TIPS for the same maturity. Then markets expect average inflation of 2.8% over the subsequent maturity.
- Can also say that given expected inflation and risk, investors require a 2.8% premium to buy nominal bonds and to assume inflation over that maturity.
#### Floating-rate notes (FRN)
#FRN
2% of the market in total. Relatively new, first issued in Jan 2014. Sold with 2 years to maturity with a variable rate of interest equal to the going rate on 13-week T-bills + a fixed spread.
- The spread entices some investors who might otherwise roll investments of short-term T-bills to sacrifice some liquidity and buy two-year FRNs instead.
- For the treasury, it locks in funding for 2 years but at a cost only slightly above that of short-term bills (less than 5 basis points in 2021)
- FRNs seem to cost less than 2 year notes because government accounting of interest rate cost does not penalize risk of rates increasing in the future.
#### Auction Schedule
The auction schedule is set by the treasury to let investors know in advance which securities will be sold when and in what quantities. It is modulated to suit both the borrowing needs of government and changing market conditions
- The most recently issued bonds of each type and maturity tend to be the ones most actively traded.
    - The just issued notes are called x-year on-the-run notes, and are likely to be the most actively traded, while the august will be the old notes, double-old notes, triple-old notes, etc.
#### Nonmarketable securities
- Savings bonds - discount securities sold directly to individual investors
- State and Local Government Series bonds (SLUGs)
##### Government Accounts
Also nonmarketable and represent the debt that the government owes itself, for example social security trust funds. It is argues that these bonds to not represent any additional treasury indebtedness and excluded from most descriptions of government indebtedness (Total debt held by the public)

Debt held by public is usually normalized by GDP, since countries with greater GDPs can safely carry greater levels of debt. 
- Debt to GDP is 100%, higher than 100% during WW2 and COVID, 80% during financial crisis.
- 230% in Japan, 175% in Greece, 100% in France, 85% in the UK
Foreign investors still find US treasuries attractive despite high ratio of US debt to GDP
### Municipal Securities
#municipal
More than 50,000 issuers and ~1,000,000 individual bond issues, issued by states and local government to fund their expenditures. Dominated by retail investors (over 70%) and indirectly by individuals through mutual funds and other investment vehicles.
- As long as funds raised are used for public projects, payments are exempt from federal tax
- Capital gains on price appreciation from munis is not exempt, so the market has evolved to minimize the proportion of return in the form of taxed price appreciation rather than untaxed interest.
- In a low-rate environment munis have a 5% coupon and consequently at a premium to par. They are therefore unlikely to trade at a discount and subject buy and hold purchasers to taxes on capital gains.
- Depends on the state if bonds are taxed in other states and exempt their own bonds. DC does not tax any while Utah exempts munis issues in states that exempt Utah's bonds (states with no income tax automatically qualify).
$500 bn of munis that don't qualify are used for working capital, funding private business development, refinancing existing debt. These pay rates comparable to corporate and Treasury markets controlling for difference in credit quality.
#### 3 Broad Categories
- General Obligation (GO) bonds - 25% of the market, backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality
- Revenue Bonds - 66%, backed by revenues from particular projects like tolls from a highway
    - Industrial revenue bonds $600 bn subset of tax exempt debt for private enterprises engaged in qualifying projects.
- Prefunded/defeased bonds - canceled as a municipal liability. Cash and Treasury securities are set aside to fund the remaining payment obligations (credit risk improved to that of treasuries).
#### Default risk
Much lower than the equivalent corporate bonds (0.08% from 1970-2020). GO bonds were considered safer than revenue bonds until Detroit went bankrupt in 2013. Holders of water and sewer bonds suffered no loss of principal while GO bonds suffered significant losses.
- GO bonds are now treated like unsecured claims.
- **Before 2008, majority of muni bonds were insured against default for a fee by private insurers. These insurers suffered but from having insured MBS during 2008. The damage to the industry resulted in less than 5% of muni issues being insured, now the number is around 10%**
### Other US Markets
#### Mortgages
Loans used to purchase properties and collateralized by those same properties. Only about 45% of loan balances are help by the original lenders. The rest are securitized.
#### Corporate and Foreign Bonds
Bonds sold by US nonfinancial corporations (45%), US financial corporations (31%), foreign corporations to US investors (24%) to raise money to fund operations and corporate transactions. 
#### Loans and Advances
Half are made by banks, the rest by an assortment of financial and nonfinancial entities. Securitization and trading of bank loans here.
#### Agency/GSE Debt
Issuing entities span a range of associations with the federal government, with varying levels of support.
- Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Small Business Administration (SBA), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) debt issues backed fully by the government.
- Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) provides electricity for local power companies is a federal agency (formally owned by the US government), and backed by its own revenue not the government.
- Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) are GSEs but owned by private shareholders, following 2008 are under government conservatorship.
    - Leading up to 2008, they were not explicitly backed by the government but market expectations for full support were realized during and after the crisis.
#### Commercial Paper
Highly rated corporations borrow short-term funds from the public.
## 0.3 - US Market Participants
Foreign entities invest $14 Tn in US debt securities on their own or as intermediaries. 

On the liability side, fed borrows $24.3 Tn, munis borrow $3.2 Tn, Households $17.3 Tn, Nonfinancial businesses $18 Tn, remaining borrow as intermediaries. The rest of the world borrows $4.9 Tn through US debt securities and loans.
### Households
The sector has significant net worth (assets exceed financial liabilities). 
- Equity and debt markets, however a greater fraction is invested through intermediaries (pensions, mutual funds, life insurance)
- Large fraction in cash equivalents (deposits/ money market funds)
- For liabilities, households borrow mostly through mortgages or consumer credit (home equity, auto, credit card, student)

![[Pasted image 20250422123749.png]]
- Decline in student loan delinquencies in 2020 is because of federal COVID forbearance programs.
### Nonfinancial Business
- Corporate businesses have established creditworthiness and broader access to markets as opposed to noncorporate (larger liabilities)
    - They can sell debt securities to raise 30% of their liabilities while noncorporate sell essentially none.
- Noncorporate rely mostly on mortgages, and the differences in liability structures reflect the life cycle of business borrowings
    - Family and friends -> bank loans -> investor groups -> private placements of debt -> public debt securities.
### Commercial Banks
Banks accept deposits, pay interest, offer customers safety through deposit insurance and liquidity for checkable deposit. Deposits (not debt securities/loans) constituted 93% of commercial bank liabilities.
- Other liabilities - bank's parent company investments, long term debt, commercial paper, assorted loans, repo
- Assets - C&I loans, real estate loans, consumer loans
    - Banks also hold liquid assets, cash, reserves, deposits at the fed, other MM instruments
    - Also hold treasuries, agency securities, and MBS to earn higher rates of return
Commercial bank assets are highly concentrated. 4,000 banks in the US but $12.5 Tn of the $19 Tn are held by the largest 25 banks.
- Number of banks in the country has been declining gradually but swiftly (likely an adjustment from historical restrictions on interstate banking and branching that prevented larger banks from satisfying market demand)
- Smaller banks hold much more in real estate loans (often local)
### Life Insurance Companies
Primarily savings vehicles where policy holder invest funds for tax deferral. They are financial intermediaries that collect and invest premiums to meet their obligations under sold policies and earn additional returns for shareholders.
- Long-term fixed income assets are natural hedges to the long-term nature of their policy liabilities.
- Asset portfolios contain large fractions of corporate bonds and equities (36.4% and 8.5%), 18.8% in mutual funds shares.
- Corporate bond investments make them significant players in that market (24% of total market)
- Treasuries are theoretically useful as a match for long-term liabilities but do not earn enough, only make up 2.4% of assets.
- Also use derivatives to achieve their return and hedging objectives.
### Pension Funds
Previously defined benefit (DB) plans, where the sponsor promises to pay retirees according to a formula (risk resides with the sponsor). Now, defined contribution (DC) plans are more important, where the employee chooses among a few investment options (risk resides with employees).
Government employees are federal, state, and local levels always have DB plans or option to participate in DB. Private sector have been migrating from DB to DC plans
- Corporations are actively shedding DB pension fund risk through pension risk transfer transactions (insurance companies assume pension liabilities).
- Long-term debt instrument naturally hedge PV of fixed liabilities for a DB PM.
- Allocations to equities hold out the prospect of having to make smaller contributions to the fund.
    - The largest 100DB plans in 2020 - 50% fixed income, 32% equity, 18% in other (real estate, PE, HF)
### Money Market Funds
Created in 1970s, designed to offer safety/immediacy while paying higher rates than banks were allowed to pay on deposits.
3 broad categories
1. Government Funds- Purchase only short-term government-backed debt
2. Prime Funds - Invest predominantly in short-term, high-quality corporate debt like commercial paper
3. Tax Exempt Funds - Invest in short-term, high-quality, tax-exempt municipal debt.
Before 2008, investors buy a share for $1 and could sell at any time for $1. 
- If a fund complies by SEC rules (2a-7)
- NAV corresponding to a value per share between 99.5c and $1.005 offer and redeem shares at a stable NAV of $1 per share. If it falls below, the fund "breaks the buck" and redeemed at the fund's NAV, making them similar to bank deposits but without government guarantee.
During 2008, money market fund investors withdrew huge volumes of cash from prime funds and deposited into government funds. Fearing flight from prime money market funds would make things worse, treasury instituted a program where it guaranteed money market fund shares for one year.
- Fed created a facility that extended nonrecourse loans to banks collateralized by asset-backed CP bought from money market funds

After the crisis, 2a-7 were tightened, institutional prime and tax-exempt MM funds as opposed to funds with only retail investors, must allow share price to float with the fund's NAV.
- Proponents argue floating NAV raise awareness that fund values can fluctuate and discourage withdrawals timed to precede a fund breaking the buck
- Opponents argues MM investors are well aware of risks, floating NAV have little bearing on flights to safety away from prime funds, increase accounting, operational, tax, legal complexities of using MM funds.
The third change was that prime and tax-exempt MM funds had to have the power under various stress conditions to impose redemption fees up to 2% and gates that prevent withdrawals for up to 10 business days in any 90-day period.
- Redemption fees are paid to the fund and intended to discourage investor withdrawals in a crisis and recover losses from liquidating assets in a crisis to meet those withdrawals. 
- Gates intended to give funds a grace period to manage under stressed market conditions (if it cannot restore stability it is liquidated)
    - Government funds may choose to include the power to impose fees and gates. May encourage earlier, preemptive redemptions

In 2020, balances in government mm funds increased markedly. Institutional prime fund balances stayed at $600 bn, retail fell from $500 bn to $200 bn.
- Prime balances fell dramatically, however in March 2020 and institutional balances fell more than retail balances.
- Federal Reserve support MM and balances recovered quickly. Possibility of redemption fees and gates in March 2020 encouraged preemptive withdrawals by prime investors and sales of assets by prime fund managers, who raised liquidity to avoid triggering fees and gates
- SEC is revisiting fees and gates and considering other changes to regulation of institutional prime funds.
## 0.4 - Monetary Policy with Abundant Reserves
Creation and maintenance of national currency achieved by purchasing government bonds with that currency. Currency of US is made of green bills "Federal Reserve Notes" (liabilities of Fed). Currency backed by government bonds.
- Outstanding currency is a liability
- Treasury securities are assets
Second role of the central bank is to provide liquidity to banks under short-term distress (since banks will often find themselves solvent but illiquid).
- Banks can borrow from Fed through the discount window on any acceptable collateral.
The third role is to "maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates ... so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates"
- Fed is said to have a "Duel Mandate" of full employment and low inflation.
