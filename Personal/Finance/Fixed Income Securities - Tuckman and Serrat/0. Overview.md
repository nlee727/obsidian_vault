### Treasuries
#treasuries
Grown from the 3rd largest behind mortgages and corporate and foreign bonds to the largest in less than a decade.

The government can fund its deficit spending with T-bills (discount securities), Treasury notes and bonds (coupon securities). Notes are issues with 10 or fewer years to maturity while bonds are more than 10 years.
- Historically, bonds were subject to a maximum, statutory rate of interest but today they are used interchangeably
#### Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)
#TIPS
rotect investors against inflation with principal amount that depend on CPI.
- Earn a fixed real/inflation-adjusted return while coupon-bearing Treasuries (nominal bonds) earn a nominal/dollar return.
Only 5.6% of the total but have large importance measuring market's perception of inflation and price of inflation risk. 
- Say nominal bonds 2.8% higher than TIPS for the same maturity. Then markets expect average inflation of 2.8% over the subsequent maturity.
- Can also say that given expected inflation and risk, investors require a 2.8% premium to buy nominal bonds and to assume inflation over that maturity.
#### Floating-rate notes (FRN)
#FRN
2% of the market in total. Relatively new, first issued in Jan 2014. Sold with 2 years to maturity with a variable rate of interest equal to the going rate on 13-week T-bills + a fixed spread.
- The spread entices some investors who might otherwise roll investments of short-term T-bills to sacrifice some liquidity and buy two-year FRNs instead.
- For the treasury, it locks in funding for 2 years but at a cost only slightly above that of short-term bills (less than 5 basis points in 2021)
- FRNs seem to cost less than 2 year notes because government accounting of interest rate cost does not penalize risk of rates increasing in the future.
#### Auction Schedule
The auction schedule is set by the treasury to let investors know in advance which securities will be sold when and in what quantities. It is modulated to suit both the borrowing needs of government and changing market conditions
- The most recently issued bonds of each type and maturity tend to be the ones most actively traded.
    - The just issued notes are called x-year on-the-run notes, and are likely to be the most actively traded, while the august will be the old notes, double-old notes, triple-old notes, etc.
#### Nonmarketable securities
- Savings bonds - discount securities sold directly to individual investors
- State and Local Government Series bonds (SLUGs)
##### Government Accounts
Also nonmarketable and represent the debt that the government owes itself, for example social security trust funds. It is argues that these bonds to not represent any additional treasury indebtedness and excluded from most descriptions of government indebtedness (Total debt held by the public)

Debt held by public is usually normalized by GDP, since countries with greater GDPs can safely carry greater levels of debt. 
- Debt to GDP is 100%, higher than 100% during WW2 and COVID, 80% during financial crisis.
- 230% in Japan, 175% in Greece, 100% in France, 85% in the UK
Foreign investors still find US treasuries attractive despite high ratio of US debt to GDP
