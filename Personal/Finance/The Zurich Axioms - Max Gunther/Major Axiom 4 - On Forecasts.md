*Human behavior cannot be predicted. Distrust anyone who claims to know the future, however dimly*

### Listening to forecasts
If you hope to get anywhere as a speculator, you must get out of the habit of listening to forecasts. Never take economists, market advisors, or other financial oracles seriously. They are right sometimes, which is what makes them dangerous.
- Since the top guessers study each other's with care, there tends often to be remarkable uniformity. 
They all forecast often and hope nobody scrutinizes the results too carefully.
- Think of Michel de Nostredame

Realize that money phenomena are manifestations of human behavior. GNP, housing, inflation are all results of human interaction, making them entirely unpredictable.
- Its almost ridiculous to forecast something like inflation. Inflation is caused by millions of people making billions of decisions: workers about wages they want to be paid, bosses about wages they are willing to pay, consumers about prices they will swallow, everybody about diffuse feelings of hardship or prosperity, fear or security, discontent or buoyancy.

### Speculative Strategy 
#losing #takingprofit 
In the world of money, which is a world shaped by human behavior, nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Seeking to escape from worry about what will happen in the future by leaning on predictions is a formula for poverty. **The successful speculator bases no moves on what will happen but reacts instead to what does happen**. Quick reactions to events that you see developing in the present. Don't let your hopes and speculations harden into an oracular pronouncement - never lose sight of the possibility you have made a bad bet. If it succeeds climb toward the ending position, If it turns sour despite all the prophets have promised, get out.
