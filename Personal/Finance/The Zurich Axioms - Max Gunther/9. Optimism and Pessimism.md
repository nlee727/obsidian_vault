*Optimism means expecting the best, but confidence means knowing how you will handle the worst. Never make a move if you are merely optimistic*

### Optimism
A general feeling of hope and good expectations cannot do you harm "I'll make it. I'll do well." This axiom is focus on optimism as it applies to specific money ventures. Professional gamblers use this as one of their most effective tools for emptying pockets of amateurs.
- An amateur poker player thinks "maybe I'll draw well" or "that guy is bluffing" when the odds are clearly not favoring a call.

### Confidence
The poker pro who can easily persuade a poker amateur to bet when he shouldn't, playing on his optimism, has confidence. Confidence springs from the constructive use of pessimism.
- Lots of the time especially in the world of finance, things are as bad as they seem (they are often worse). In fact, they are worse at least as often as they are better. The safest course, almost always, is to assume that if a situation looks bad, it is.
Seek confidence, not expecting the best but knowing how you will handle the worst.

Say you enter a venture - ask yourself how will you save yourself if the cards fell against you?
- Always walk into a venture with a smart exit. While for stocks, it can be as easy as selling, know how it will be done in more illiquid markets like real-estate.

Any venture, as you begin it, has a limitless number of possible futures, some good and some bad. Both are equally likely, but which kind of outcome feels the more likely to you? Obviously the good kind.
- Bulls outnumber bears by a big margin, and the majority of market readings are optimistic. This is just how the exasperating human psyche operates.

### Speculative Strategy
Optimism feels good and is dangerous for that very reason, producing a general clouding of judgement leading into ventures with no exits. Even where there is an exit, optimism can persuade you not to use it. Before committing your money to a venture ask how you will save yourself if things go wrong. Once you have that its no longer optimism but confidence.
