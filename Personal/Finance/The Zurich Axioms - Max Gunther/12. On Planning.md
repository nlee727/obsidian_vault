*Long-range plans engender the dangerous belief that the future is under control. It is important never to take your own long-range plans, or other people's, seriously.*

### Future
It is often the case that long-range plans cause roots, and the mobile person is able to stay out of the way of trouble.
- Say you figure retirement and pension on X dollars a month is sufficient, it may be sufficient now but you really have no idea what will happen.
- Planning, followed by the unexpected will lead to demise.
It's easy to retreat into the cozy comfort of your plan and avoid risk. 

You can dimly see the structure of next week. There is just enough continuity in events to allow one to do that. You can make a financial plan for next week, perhaps, and allow some margin for error and make a fairly reliable prediction on the value of your assets and spending.
- For all you know the market could crash, you can get into an accident
- A month ahead this is vastly more dim, a year, 20 years, this is impossible. **If you can't know what you're planning for, how can you construct a sensible plan?**

A plan is a lifelong illusion of order. It is ridiculous to think you can see the world's future by simply looking at trends in evidence today. Some of the trends will stay, whole new trends will come into existence, unknowable events, booms, busts, etc. 

Stay light on your feet, and instead of attempting to organize your affairs to accommodate unknowable events in the future, react to events as they unfold in the present. When you see opportunities, go for them. When you see danger, jump out of the way. These long range plans will only get in your way.

## Minor Axiom 16 - Shun long-term investments
Jesse Livermore wrote "I believe it is a safe bet that the money lost by short-term speculation is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments ride." Betting on tomorrow is chancy enough. Betting on a day twenty or thirty years later is absolutely crazy.
- It relieves you of the need to make frequent, perhaps painful decisions. This caters to laziness and cowardice. A diversified portfolio gives you that cozy immersed feeling.
- In real estate, commissions are significant, but in most other speculative worlds, they are not worth much.
Don't get rooted. Every investment should be at the very least reevaluated and made to justify itself afresh every 3 months or so.
- Would I put my money into this if it were presented to me for the first time today? Is it progressing toward the ending position I envisioned?

### Speculative Strategy
It is futile and dangerous planning for a future you cannot see. Do not get rooted in long-range plans or long-term investments. Instead, react to events as they unfold in the present. Put your money into ventures as they present themselves and withdraw from hazards. Value the freedom of movement, and don't sign that freedom away.
- The only long-term financial plan you need is the intention to get rich. The how is impossible to know.
