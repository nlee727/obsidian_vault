*Always take your profit too soon. Conquering greed will make you a better speculator than 99 percent of other men and women scrambling after wealth.*
#### Greed
Greed, defined in this context as excessive acquisitiveness (wish to improve one's material well being): wanting more than you came in for or more than you have a right to expect. Akin to losing control of your desire.

#### Sherlock Feldman
Lifelong study of greed, worked as a casino manager for many years.
- His axiom - "If they wanted less, they'd go home with more"

### Walking Away
In the course of gambling or speculative play, you will enjoy streaks and runs of luck. Undoubtedly you will have the good sense to recognize that they cannot last forever.
- Assume that any set or series of events producing a gain for you will be of short duration, and that profit wont be extravagantly big
- You are better off playing the averages, which overwhelmingly favor quitting early
- Always bet on the short and modest, when you have good profit, cash out and walk away

You will also get in situations where you will regret having walked away, and you'll be counting all the money you did not make. This decision, while in hindsight may seem wrong was not. Always think in the long run.

### What does "too soon" mean?
Refers to the need to cash out before a set of winning events has reached its peak. 
- **Don't ever try to squeeze the last possible dollar from a set**.
- **Don't worry about the possibility that the set still has a long way to go (regret)**
- **Don't fear regret**

Stock speculation is subject to this on a much greater degree than something like real-estate because prices are quotes every day. This is just a source of personal torment. This frenzy can cloud one's judgement to a hazardous degree. Don't let a previous missed opportunity ruin your ability to sell in the future.

## Minor Axiom 3 - Decide in advance what gain you want from a venture, and when you get it, get out
As speculation succeeds and your wealth grows, every new position feels like a starting position. Wins are taken for granted, feeling as though you have always had this much wealth.
- Because of this you are going to have a hard time extricating yourself from the venture.
Most of the time, you will be required to call your own endings, which is very hard to do. AN ending is a time when you withdraw and briefly relax. Make the end feel like one instead of a new starting position. 
- Reinforce the ending feeling by rigging some kind of reward for yourself, taking some winning and buying yourself x,y,z.
- Investment capital is money just like any other, while there are certainly reasons for sitting on it, skimming off the top especially at ending positions is a better idea than generally credited.

### Speculative Strategy
Don't wait to time a peak, or for winning streaks to go on and on. Cash out and walk away after reaching your end, even when everyone around you is saying the boom will keep roaring along. The only exception to this is an unusual situation where you are **certain** of continuation. Get in the habit of selling too soon and keep your mental state **clean**.
