*It is unlikely that God's plan for the universe includes making you rich*

### Religion
You can't pray yourself rich, you are more likely to pray yourself poor if anything. Depending on God to bring you wealth will drop your guard.
- Similar to the leaning on a forecast or an illusion of order. It lulls you into a dangerously unworried state.

- Occult beliefs can get in the way of sound speculative thinking. Leaning on such beliefs may not be hazardous to your health, but it is to your money.

## Minor Axiom 12 - If astrology worked, all astrologers would be rich
If you are attracted by astrology or some other mystical or supernatural doctrine, by all means enter into its substance and spirit as deeply as it pleases you. But before you try to use it to help you make money, do yourself a favor. Look around at the practitioners of this doctrine (particularly at those who profess to be its teachers/gurus). Ask yourself: are they rich?

## Minor Axiom 13 - A superstition need not be exorcised. It can be enjoyed, provided it is kept in its place
Any religious or mystical belief can be a serious hazard to anybody who would get rich. Instead of scoffing it out of your life, learn how and when it can reasonably play a role in your financial life.
- Superstitions are to be used humorously - in a situation that will not lend itself to rational analysis (picking a lotto number, gambling, etc.)
- Getting it out of your system.

### Speculative Strategy
Essentially money and the supernatural are an explosive mixture that could blow up in your face (duh). Its dangerous as it lulls you into an unworried state which is never good to be in. Lean on nothing but your own good wits.
