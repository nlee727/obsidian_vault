*When the ship starts to sink, don't pray. Jump*
### Losing
Important to note when it *starts* to sink. Hoping and praying are not good, rather look around at what's happening, study the situation, and ask yourself whether the problem is likely to get fixed/evidence that improvement is on the way. 
- Gerald Loeb's rule of thumb - sell whenever a stock's price has retreated 10-20 percent from the highest price at which you have held it regardless of whether it is for a gain or loss.
- Taking small losses to protect from big ones

### 3 Obstacles
1. Fear of regret - fear  a loser will turn into a winner after you've gone away. Although uncommon, it is unavoidable.
2. The need to abandon part of an investment - Maximum pain, but practice and it gets better. Gets even worse when speculating on margin
3. Difficult in admitting you were wrong - to some its a minor nuisance, some find it the biggest obstacle

## Minor Axiom 4 - Accept small losses cheerfully as a fast of life. Expect to experience several while awaiting a large gain
The fact of the matter is if you habitually cut your losses small, you aren't likely to ever be badly hurt. Think of it as all part of earning a living like taxes and bills. 

When it comes to stop-losses, they could be useful but instead depend on your own capacity to reach hard decisions and follow them through.

### Speculative Strategy
Don't wait around when trouble shows itself, instead get away promptly. Hope and prayer are not tools of speculative operation. Look at the 3 obstacles and overcome them one way or another. There is no advice as to how these obstacles should be overcome, that is something individual. Learning to take losses is one of the most essential techniques.
