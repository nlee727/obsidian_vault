*Worry is not a sickness but a sign of health. If you are not worried, you are not risking enough.*
### Security
Escaping worry is paramount. Most people grasp at security as though it were the most important thing in the world, however adventure is what makes life worth living. The only way to have an adventure is to expose yourself to risk. 
- Worry is a constant part of a way of life (only enough to make life spicy).
### Income as Support
The economic structure of the world is rigged against you (wage and income cannot be the main pillar of support unless it means getting through life without having to beg for food)
- Frank Henry's rule of thumb - Only $\frac{1}{2}$ of one's financial energies should be devoted to job income. The other half ought to go into investment and speculation.
Of course you stand to lose. However as an ordinary tax-hounded, inflation-raddled American income-earner, what real difference does it make if you get a bit poorer while trying to get richer? An adventure is guaranteed, with the potential for gain much higher than the potential loss - **This is the game that is rigged in your favor**.

There is no difference between speculation and investing. Its like the difference between luncheon and lunch. You get the same sandwich - the only difference is in the impression somebody wants to make

## Minor Axiom 1 - Always play for meaningful stakes
*If you bet $100 and double your money, you're still poor*

If an amount is so small that its loss won't make any significant difference, then it isn't likely to bring you any significant gains either. Perhaps you start modestly and increase the dosage of worry as you gain experience and confidence in your own psyche - it all about finding your own level of tolerable risk.
- Take the chance, its always possible to scrabble some more any try again

## Minor Axiom 2 - Resist the allure of diversification
*While reducing risk, diversification reduces by the same degree any hope you may have of getting rich*

There are 3 major flaws with diversification
1. Violating Minor Axiom 1 - if your entire starting capital is not itself very meaningful, diversifying is only going to make things worse. You will win at best trivial amounts.
2. You create a situation in which gains and losses are likely to cancel each other out, leaving you exactly where you began
3. By diversifying, you become a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air all at once. The more speculations you get into, the more time and study they require. This will cause paralysis, as problem after problem presents itself and they are being pressured to make too many painful decisions too fast.

That is not to say only focus on one thing at a time. 3 good speculations, maybe 4+. This is a matter of personal preference and individual thinking habits. Its all about the number you can effectively handle. The point is to not diversify for the point of diversifying.

### Speculative Strategy
Put your money at risk. Don't be afraid of getting hurt a little. By being willing to face it, you give yourself the only realistic chance you have of rising above the great unrich, and the price you pay for this glorious chance is a state of worry. However, this state is not the sickness modern psychology believes it to be, rather it is the lively essence of life - an adventure.
