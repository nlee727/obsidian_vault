*Disregard the majority opinion. It is probably wrong*
### Rene Descartes
The world's best doubter, refusing to believe anything until he had verified it for himself, making him a successful gambler-speculator.
- Made a scientific study of gambling, rejecting all gambling cliches and folk wisdom, insisting on establishing truth or fallacy for himself. His trick was to over and over again, disregard what everybody tells you until you have thought it through for yourself.
- **"It is more likely that the truth has been found by few than by many"**
This is hard to do in our democratic age where the rightness of majorities is pounded into our heads in grade school. 

In finance, pieces of supposedly wise advice are embedded in popular consciousness. 
- A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, build a diversified portfolio, only bet what you can afford to lose, etc.
- It's also true that the majority of people are not rich

## Minor Axiom 14 - Never follow speculative fads. Often, the best time to buy something is when nobody else wants it.
As a general rule, the price of a stock falls when substantial numbers of people come to believe it isn't worth buying. The more unappetizing they find it, the lower it drops. Hence the great paradox of when to buy low and sell high: the best time to buy is precisely when the majority of people are saying "Don't!"

It is notoriously hard to think yes when everybody around you is shouting no. Majorities are always dissuading them from carrying out good moves. Majority pressure can not only dislodge a good hunch; it can even make us doubt ourselves when we know we're right. 
- **Probably the best defense against majority pressure is just the awareness of its existence and coercive power.**

Brokers and others who take orders will naturally tend to push whatever is hot at the moment. Take gold for example - during a recession, demand for gold increases substantially, and it is also the time when selling gold will be the highest.

### Contrarians
Their philosophy is derived from the previous paradox about buying when everyone else says no. The issue is that it starts with a good idea but hardens into a grandiose illusion of order. While it is true that the best time to buy is when no one else wants it, buying unthinkingly for that reason is almost as silly as to bet unthinkingly with the herd.

### Speculative Strategy
The majority though not always and not automatically wrong, is more likely to be wrong that right. Figure everything out for yourself before putting your money at risk. The greatest pressures on you and the most frequently felt will be those that push you into betting with the majority, for it is in their nature to make you buy when prices are high and sell when they are low. Be aware of its existence.
