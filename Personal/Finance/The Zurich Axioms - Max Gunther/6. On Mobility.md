*Avoid putting down roots. They impede motion.*

### Roots
Rootlessness is in the same category as worry. The more earnestly you seek that feelings of being surrounded by the old, the familiar, and the comfortable, the less successful you are likely to be as a speculator. This is in the context of a rootless state of mid and a habitual method of organizing your life.

## Minor Axiom 9 - Do not become trapped in a souring venture because of sentiments like loyalty and nostalgia
There are times when you have to choose between roots and money. If you are interested in money, it is a mistake to let yourself get too attached to any physical thing in which you capital is invested. Get attached to people but not to houses, companies, etc.

## Minor Axiom 10 - Never hesitate to abandon a venture if something more attractive comes into view
The trickiest way in which you get rooted in speculation is if you are in a situation where you aren't sure if you are conducting speculation or a hobby.
- Collection of rare coins/stamps, turning your living room into an art museum - cant bring yourself to sell your stuff.
The problem arises when another speculation may come into view while your capital value is trapped in things you aren't selling because of attachment.

Another way is if you are waiting for something to pay off. Say you buy a stock with a goal ending position, and it moves sideways. In the meantime, other speculative opportunities are arising.
- There is a constant feeling that you owe it enough time to show what it can do, but if you see something better, change trains.
- The fear of regret also plays into effect here, you need to acknowledge it (it plays both ways - switching vs not switching)

### Speculative Strategy
Preserving your mobility is important, don't let roots grow too thick to cut. Sentiments like loyalty, hang-ups like the wish to wait around for a payoff are all detriments of your speculative career. Always be ready to jump away from trouble or seize opportunities quickly. Your speculations should be made only after careful assessment of the odds for and against, and no move should be make for trivial reasons, but you must be ready to sever roots and go when something clearly more promising comes into view.
