Early Position
- UTG, UTG+1, UTG+2
Middle Position

In short stack situations, early positions are better because you get to go all in before him

### Drawing
Drawer must get a good price to get a card

#### Expected Value
Win% * Win Amount - Lose% * Lose Amount
Calling threshold is at EV = 0

#### Pot Odds
Relationship of the call amount to the size of the pot
% of pot that you contribute with the call

In general, a call will be +EV if Win% > Call Amount / Pot After Call

### Phil Gordon
Each out is worth 2% equity per card
If you get to see both turn and river, use 4% per card

### Implied Odds
Number of Chips you need to win after hitting the draw to make the call worth it
Amount of dead money you need to add

Bet Amount/Win% - (Pot + Bet Amount + Call Amount)

Only count FULL outs
Implied Odds on Sets are huge

Don't bet so little on made hands that you are giving the other player the odds to call. Most of your bets on made hands should be 2/3 pot to punish for making a draw

### Fold Equity
The value that you get in a hand from the likelihood that the other player will fold
SD Value = (1-Fold%) * EV if called
Fold% = Your bet/Pot After bet

For no Showdown value
Pot * Fold% - Bet * (1-Fold%)
- If SD-Win%=0

For some showdown value
Pot * Fold% - Bet * (1-Fold%) * EV if called
- If SD-Win%=0

Each 1% your showdown increases, you decrease fold% by 1.5%
