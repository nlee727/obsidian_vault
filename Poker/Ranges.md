### Re-Raising Preflop
Usually high pair

### Flop
Betting with high pair, checking with everything else


### Example Scenario
Player raises preflop, BB calls

Flop is A,7,2 rainbow

Raising player has the range advantage, since he has a higher chance of A than the BB, who may have something like connectors or suited cards

Even though the raise may have something like J 10, he should still play because he has a better range advantage

### Coin Flip
J Pair has 16 cards you beat and 18 cards that beat you

Even though opponent has A T, they still have a good chance at beating you

### Range changes
Looking at the previous example
You have JJ, Player may have AK, AA, KK, QQ

If an ace is revealed on the flop, possible AK hands go from 16 to 12, while possible high pairs go from 18 to 13
'Usually' you want to make this decision with the cards in your deck not the flash cards

Range increases the later position that you get
