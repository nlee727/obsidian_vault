## Preflop
#### Default Preflop Bet sizing when Deep Stacked
- Do not raise to a specific size
- When 100bbs or deeper, pot sized raises are ideal
	- Pot sized raise = 3x last bet + any additional money in the pot
	- For example, 3 limpers is 6.5bbs
- Raise one "unit" larger form out of position
	- Instead of 3x last bet, 4x last bet

- If a raise would put in more than 30% of the stack, go all-in
#### Exploitative Preflop Bet Sizing
- Against strong players, use same sizing in similar situations
- Against bad players, raise larger with your best hands against calling stations
- Raise larger with your bluffs against habitual folders
