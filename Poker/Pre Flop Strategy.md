## Strong Strategies

	- First person to call the big blind
	- Fold or open raise
-  Raise bigger over limps with cards you want to play
	- 4 or 5 big blinds plus 1 for every other limper
-  Call **less** often pre-flop
	- Get out of the mindset that I will call because I have a playable hand
	- Benefits of playing aggressively, potentially folding out better hands
-   Play big hands fast, eliminate slow play
	- 3 bet, 
- Position is everything
	-  In position, not the first 2 players.
	- In position is good for making the most amount of money post flop

	- They will only continue with premium hands
- Know your ranges
