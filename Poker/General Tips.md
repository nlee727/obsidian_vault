#### Value Bet
1. When a player raises, usually premium hand or draw
	1. Usually want to snug fold here
2. When a player calls, usually marginal hand or draw
	1. Continue to value bet with hands that beat your opponents marginal made hands

2. If your opponent wants to put chips in the pot, you need a premium made hand or strong draw to continue
