Unsupervised ML is better suited for finding new patterns, more powerful in learning new things

#### Strengths
Problems that are not narrow, or constantly changing, labeled data is scarce
#### Weaknesses
Number of clusters is unknown

### Metrics for association rules
Frequency and Strength of association
- Support
$$\text{Support} = \frac{\text{frequency(X,Y)}}{N}$$
- Confidence
$$\text{Confidence} = \frac{\text{frequency(X,Y)}}{\text{frequency(X)}}$$
- Lift
    - Confidence/Support
    - Greater than 1 imply the antecedent and consequent are associated with each other
    - Equal to 1 imply independence
    - Less than 1 imply a negative correlation

$$\text{Lift} = \frac{\text{support(X,Y)}}{\text{support(X)}\times \text{support(X)}}$$
