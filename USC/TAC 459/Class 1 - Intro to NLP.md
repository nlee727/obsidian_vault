## NLP Techniques
### Tokenization
Breaking text into smaller units (tokens) like words or phrases
- Essential for text analysis and processing enabling tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition
### Stemming
Reducing words to their base or root form to analyze variations
- Simplifies analysis by treating different word forms as identical
- "Running, runs, ran" -> "Run"
## Word Embeddings
Representing words as numerical vectors in a continuous space since computers only understand numerical values
- Maps words to dense vectors capturing semantic relationships
- "king" and "queen" close together in the vector space, indicating their semantic relationship
