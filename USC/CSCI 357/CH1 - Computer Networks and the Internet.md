### Nuts and Bolts View
Home Network -> Regional ISP -> Global ISP
- Internet is a recursive network of networks
    - ISP gets their services from other ISPs, and eventually reaching a global ISP
    - A bunch of connected components

Modem - modulation and demodulation 
- Convert analog to digital data and backwards

Communication links
- fiber, copper, radio satellite
- Transmission maximum rate: bandwidth

Protocols - control sending and receiving of messages
- TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 801.11 (wifi)

Internet Standards
- RFC: Request for comments 
- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
    - Would take one of the RFC that many people are using and they standardize
Must use the same protocol

### A Service View
Infrastructure that provides services to applications
### Protocol
Specific message sent, specific actions taken when the message is received
- Define format, order of messages send and received among network entities, actions taken on message transmission, receipt
