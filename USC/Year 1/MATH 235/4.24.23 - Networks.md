### Networks
A graph is a set of nodes with edges


## Definition
Given a graph with $n$ points ($n$ nodes) the adjacency matrix $A$ of the graph is an $nxn$ matrix such that $a_{{ij}}=1$ if node $v_{i}$ is connected to $v_{j}$. If not, $a_{{ij}}=0$

$$
\text{example: }
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

such that the horizontal are nodes $v_{1},\dots,v_{n}$ and vertical are nodes $v_{1},\dots,v_{n}$

#### Properties
1. An adjacency matrix is symmetric $(A^T=A)$
2. An adjacency matrix is non defective

### Definition
$v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are connected by a path of length $k$ if one can go from $v_{c}$ to $v_{j}$ along $k$ edges
### Theorem
The coefficient $\alpha_{ij}$ of $A^k$ is the number of paths of length $k$ from $v_{i}$ to $v_{J}$.
- will be useful to diagonalize its powers to make the computation $A^k$ easier
