## Definition
If $T:V\rightarrow W$ is bijective, then $T^{-1}:W\rightarrow V$ is defined by $T^{-1}(\vec{w})=\vec{v}$ iff $T(\vec{v})=\vec{w}$ and is the inverse transformation of $T$

### Theorem
$T:\mathbb{R^n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R^n}$ with matrix $A$ has an inverse iff $A$ is nonsingular
##### Note:
$A^{-1}$ is the matrix of $T^{-1}$

## Definition: 
If $\exists T:\rightarrow W$ s.t. $T$ is bijective, then $T$ is an isomorphism and $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic, usually denotes $V\cong W$.
