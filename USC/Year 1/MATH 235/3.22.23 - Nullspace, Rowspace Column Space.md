Dimension of null space is at most the number of columns  (P), therefore you need to find the basis

## Definition
**Row Space**: 
Span of the amount of rows, at most dimension $P$
$$
R(A)=span\{ \vec{R}_{1},\dots,\vec{R}_{p} \}
$$

**Column Space**:
Columns of the matrix, vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ column space of A is the span of P columns
$$
C(A)=span\{ \vec{C}_{1},\dots \vec{C}_{p} \}
$$
where $\vec{C}$ are column vectors

#### Properties:
1) $A,B$ are $nxp$ matrices
$A$ and $B$ are row-equivalent $\Longleftrightarrow R(A) = R(B)$ 
2) If $U$ is a REF (or RREF) of $A$, then the non zero rows of $U$, form a basis of $R(A)$
	1) The rows left after elimination are the basis of A
3) If $U$ is a REF of $A$, then dim$C(U)$=dim$C(A)$, and the columns of $U$ with the leading 1's form a basis of $C(U)$ and the columns of $A$ those columns of $U$ correspond to form a basis of $C(A)$

## Rank-Nullity theorem
Given an $nxp$ matrix $A$, dim$N(A)$ + dim$R(A)$= P, number of columns
