### Definition
Given an $nxn$ matrix $A$, we call the **adjoint** of $A$ denoted by $adj(A)$, the $nxn$ matrix obtained by transposing the matrix of cofactors of each entry of $A$.

$$
adj(A) = \begin{bmatrix}
c_{11} & c_{12} & c_{1n} \\
c_{21} & c_{22} & c_{2n} \\
c_{31} & c_{32} & c_{3n}
\end{bmatrix}^T
$$
### Theorem
$$
A_{x}*adj(A) = \det(A)*I
$$
#### Property
If $A$ is nonsingular
$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}*adj(A)
$$
## Cramer's Method
Consider the $nxn$ system
$$
A\vec{x}=\vec{b}
$$
where $$
\vec{x}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1} \\
x_{2} \\
x_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and $A$ is nonsingular

### Theorem
$$
x_{i}=\frac{\det(A_{i})}{\det(A)}
$$
where $A_{i}$ is obtained from $A$ by replacing its "i-th" column by b

$$
x = \frac{1}{\det(A)} *adj(A)*\vec{b}
$$
