$\mathbb{N}$ = Set of natural integers {1,2,3,4,...}
$\mathbb{Z}$ = Set of all integers {-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...}
$\mathbb{Q}$ = Set of all number that can be written as a ratio of integers w/ denominator $\neq 0$
$\mathbb{R}$ = Real numbers, rational or irrational
$\mathbb{C}$ = Set of numbers that contain complex numbers

##### Addition
0 is not a real number as it is a lack of measurement, however, it is a number in an algebraic sense.
$$
0+n=n
$$
Negative number $n$, where $n$ is a natural integer of the number you add to $n$ to get 0.
$$
-7+7=0
$$


##### Multiplication
- Multiplication is commutative, associative
- Multiplication is distributive over addition
1 is the number you can multiply any number by without changing it.
$$
1*n=n
$$
$n$ in *$\mathbb{Z}$

##### Division
- Multiplication of a reciprocal
- Division is not commutative
$$
\mathbb{Q} = \left\{  \frac{a}{b}  \right\}
$$
$a$ in $\mathbb{Z}$
$a$ multiplied by the reciprocal of $b$, where $b$ $\neq 0$
$b\neq 0$ because $0$ does not have a reciprocal

##### Remark
We created set of numbers containing each, then 
$$
\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}
$$
$\mathbb{R}$ is expanding $\mathbb{Q}$ in a way that gives one more solutions.
$$
x^2-2=0
$$
However, you can't solve
$$
x^2+1=0
$$
in $\mathbb{C}$, we can do anything in terms of algebra except that 0, still, has no reciprocal
$$
\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}\subset\mathbb{C}
$$
