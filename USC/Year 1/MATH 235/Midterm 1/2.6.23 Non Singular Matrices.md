### Theorem:
Characterization of non singular matrices
Given an $nxn$ matrix $A$, the following statements are equivalent
1) $A$ is non singular
2) $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a unique solution, for any $\vec{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$
3) $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ has $\vec{x}=\vec{0}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ as its unique solution
4) $A$ is row equivalent to $I$

##### Why:
$1\to 2, 2\to 3, 3\to 4, 4\to 1$
- $1\to 2$
- $2\to 3$
	- Take $\vec{b}=\vec{0}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ so $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}_{R^n}$ has a unique solution when $\vec{x}=\vec{0}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ is for sure a solution so it is the only one
- $3 \to 4$
	- If $\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ is the only solution to $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$, then $A$ is now equivalent to $I$.
	- **Fact**: If $u$ is a square matrix in REF and none of the diagonal entries are $0$, then $u$ has $I$ as RREF.
	- If one of the diagonal entries of $u$ is $0$, then we can create an entire row of $0$'s in $u$, then $a\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ have infinitely many solutions. 
		- Contradiction to $\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ is the unique solution to $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$
	- Our assumption is wrong so A must be row equivalent to $I$.
- $4\to 1$
	- If a matrix is row equivalent to $I$, it is non singular.


#### Property 1:
If there is at least one $\vec{b}\neq \vec{0}_{\mathbb{R^n}}$ such that $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a unique solution, then $A$ is non singular.

##### Remark: 
If $\vec{b}=\vec{0}$ we know its true from the theorem

###### Why:
Say $\vec{u}$ is the unique solution to $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ so $A\vec{u}=\vec{b}$.
Assume $A$ is singular. Then by theorem, $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ has other solutions than $\vec{x}=\vec{0}$. 
Call $y\neq \vec{0}$ with $A\vec{y}=\vec{0}$ 
$A(\vec{u}+\vec{y}) = A\vec{u}+A\vec{y}$
$= \vec{b} + \vec{0}$
so $\vec{u} + \vec{y}$ is a solution to $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ which is a counter example

#### Property 2:
$A,b$ are $nxn$ matrices
If $AB$  is non singular, then $A$ and $B$ are non singular
###### Recall:
We had proved that if $A,B$ are non singular, then $AB$ is non singular

Case where $B$ is singular then $B\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ has infinitely many solutions
- But so does $AB(\vec{x)} = \vec{0}$ since $AB(\vec{x}) = A(B\vec{x)}$
$= A(\vec{0}=\vec{0}$
so $AB$ is singular

Case where $A$ is singular.
