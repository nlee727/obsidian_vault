## Definition:
2 systems with $p$ unknowns are equivalent when they have the same set of solutions.

##### Row-Echelon Matrix
An $nxm$ matric that satisfies the following:
1) If there are any 0 rows, they are at the bottom of the matrix
2) The first non-zero entry of any row is a 1 (the leading one)
3) The leading 1 of the row is to the right of the leading 1 of the row above for any row below the first row

###### Reduced Row-Echelon Matrix
1) Row-Echelon
2) Any column with a leading 1 has 0's everywhere else

#### Row Operations:
1) $P_{ij} -$Switch rows $i$ and $j$
2) $M_{i}(k)-$Multiply a row by a non-zero constant 
3) $A_{ij}(k)-$Add a multiple of one row to another row

#### Elimination:
A^# = $$
\begin{bmatrix}
A | b
\end{bmatrix}
$$
##### Gaussian Elimination:
$A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$
1) Take A^# and put it into REF
2) Apply back solution
##### Gauss-Jordan elimination
1) Take A^# and put it into RREF
2) Apply back substitution
