## Algebra on vectors:
In $\mathbb{R}^2$ (2d), or in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (3d), a vector is given by:
- A direction (line that the vector is parallel to)
- An orientation
- A length
##### Remark: 
The starting point of a vector does not matter.
(Drawing)
#### Definition:
- Given 2 vectors $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$ 
- $\bar{u}+\vec{v}$ is the vector obtained starting $\bar{v}$ at the end of $\vec{u}$ and then joining the start of $\vec{u}$ with the end of $\vec{v}$.
(Drawing $\vec{v}$ starts at the end of $\vec{u}$)
### Properties:
1) $\bar{u}+\bar{v}=\bar{v}+\bar{u}$ 
	1) **Addition is commutative
2) Given 3 vectors $\bar{u},\bar{v},\bar{w}$, 
	1) $(\bar{u}+\bar{v})+\bar{w}=\bar{u}+(\bar{v}+\bar{w})$ 
	2) (Drawing)
	3) **Addition is associative
3) $\vec{0}$, the zero vector, is a vector with no length a.k.a, $\vec{0}$ is any point.
4) $\bar{u}+(-\bar{u})=\vec{0}$
	1) $-\bar{u}$ is the vector with same direction and length as $\bar{u}$ but **opposite orientation**.
#### Definition:
- Given a vector $\bar{u}$ and a scalar
- The scalar multiplication of $\bar{u}$ by $\alpha$, denoted by $\alpha \cdot{}\bar{u}$ is
- The vector parallel to $\bar{u}$ (same direction)
- Length equal to the length of $\bar{u}$ times the absolute value of $\alpha$
- Orientation of $\alpha \cdot\bar{u}$ is the same as $\bar{u}$ (LOOK AT NOTES)
### Properties:
1) $\alpha \cdot(\bar{u}+\bar{v})=\alpha \cdot \bar{u}+\alpha \cdot \bar{v}$
	1) $\cdot$ is distributive over addition of vectors
2) $(\alpha+\beta)\cdot \bar{u}=\alpha \cdot \bar{u}+\beta \cdot \bar{u}$
	1) $\cdot$ is distributive over addition of numbers
3) $(\alpha \beta)\cdot \bar{u}=\alpha \cdot(\beta \cdot \bar{u})$ 
4) $1\cdot \bar{u}=\bar{u}$
5) $\vec{0}\cdot \bar{u}=\vec{0}$
6) $(-1)\cdot \bar{u}=-\bar{u}$
7) $\alpha \cdot \vec{0}=\vec{0}$
##### Theorem:
if 
$$
\bar{u}=(u_{1},u_{2},u_{3})
$$
$$
\bar{v}=(v_{1},v_{2,}v_{3})
$$
then,
$$
\bar{u}+\bar{v}=(u_{1}+v_{1},u_{2}+v_{2},u_{3}+v_{3})
$$
$$
\alpha \cdot \bar{u}=(\alpha u_{1},\alpha u_{2},\alpha u_{3})
$$
