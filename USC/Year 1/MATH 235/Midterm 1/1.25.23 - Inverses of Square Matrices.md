#### Definition:
Given an $nxn$ matrix $A$, if there exists an $nxn$ matrix $B$, such that $$
AB=I=BA
$$
then $A$ is non-singular and $B$ is an inverse for $A$.
Similarly, $B$ is also non-singular and $A$ is an inverse of $B$

Example:
$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \quad
B= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 5 \\
0 & 1 & -4 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Check that $A$ is non-singular and $B$is an inverse for $A$.
Do $AB$ and $BA$

###### Remark:
With numbers, if $ab=1$ (then $ba=1$) $b$ is unique, i.e. the reciprocal of $A$ is unique ($\frac{1}{a}$ or $a^{-1}$)

##### Property:
If $A$ is non-singular, then $A$ has a **unique** inverse. That inverse will be denoted by $A^{-1}$ 

###### Why:
If $A$ is nonsingular, there at least one matrix $B$ with $AB=I=BA$. Assume there is another inverse, namely a matrix $C$ such that $AC=I=CA$.

##### Remark:
There are many matrices with no inverse. These are called **singular***.
