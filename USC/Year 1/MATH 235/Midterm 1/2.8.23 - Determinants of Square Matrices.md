#### Definition:
If $A$ is a $2x 2$ matrix, $\det({A})=ad - bc$ = $|A|$

#### Definition:
If $A$ is a $3x 3$ matrix,

$$
\det(A) = a_{11}(2x 2) - a_{12}(2x 2) + a_{13}(2x 2)
$$

where the 2x2 matrix is the matrix created when you delete the row and column of $a_{1x}$

### Determinant:
For a $4x 4$ matrix, calculate using 4 $3x 3$ determinants, alternating signs with each. Top left corner is always positive.

##### Note:
To compute an $nx n$ determinant, you need to calculate $n$ determinants of size $(n-1) x (n-1)$.

## Definition:
Given an $nxn$ matrix $A=(a_{ij})$

The minor associated to the entry $a_{(ij)}$, denoted by $M_{(ij)}$ is the determinant you are left with by erasing row $i$ and column $j$. 

Cofactor of $a_{ij} =M_{{ij}}$ $(-1)^{i+j}$ 

### Theorem:
You can use the expansion of the cofactor of $a_{ij}$ using any row or any column to get $\det(A)$

#### Properties:
1) $\det(A^T)=\det(A)$
2) If $A$ has a row or a column of 0's, then $\\det(A)$ = 0.
3) If $A$ is a triangular matrix, then the product of the diagonal entries yields $\det(A)$
	1) $\det(I) = 1$
5) If $2$ rows (or columns) of $A$ are swapped, then $\det(A)$ is multiplied by $-1$
6) If $A$ has a row multiplied by a non zero scalar $\alpha$, then $\det(A)$ is multiplied by $\alpha$
7) If a multiple of a row of $A$ is added to another row, then $\det(A)$ stays the same.
	1) If $A$ has 2 identical rows or columns then $\det(A) = 0$

$\det(A)=0 \leftrightarrow A$ is singular
