#### Definition 1
Given two propositions A and B,
**IF A THEN B**
	This is called a **CONDITIONAL** statement. A is called the hypothesis, B the conclusion
	
The **Reciprocal** (aka **CONVERSE**) is:
	**IF B THEN A**
	
The **Inverse** is:
	**IF NOT A THEN NOT B**
	
The **Contrapositive** is:
	**IF NOT B THEN NOT A**

##### Remark: 
The inverse of IF A THEN B can also be seen as the contrapositive of the reciprocal statement IF B THEN A.

##### Fact:
If the conditional statement is true, so is the contrapositive
If the reciprocal is true, so is the inverse

#### Definition 2
If "**IF A THEN B**" is true, **B** is a necessary condition for  **A**
- **A** implies **B**, or $A\implies B$

#### Definition 3
If "**IF A THEN B**" AND "**IF B THEN A**" is true, the two propositions are **Equivalent**
- **B** is a necessary and sufficient condition for **A**
- **A IF AND ONLY IF B**, or $A \Longleftrightarrow B$
- **IF A THEN B** is true is equivalent to **IF NOT B THEN NOT A** is true
	- Two propositions are equivalent if and only if their inverses are equivalent


### Problem 1
1) The wind is not cold
2) the wind is not strong or not cold
3) Right now, I couldn't eat some cake and some ice cream
4) Not everyone in the class likes chocolate
5) At least one likes being stuck at home
6) No one person got the correct answer

### Problem 2
1) For all integers $n$, $n^2-n+41$ is a prime number
	1) *There exists some integer $n$ such that $n^2-n+41$ is not a prime number*
2) *There exists two integers $p$ and $q$ such that $\sqrt{ 3 } =\frac{p}{q}$
	1) For all integers $p$,$q$, $\sqrt{ 3 } \neq\frac{p}{q}$
3) *For every number $x\geq 0$, there exists at least one number $y$ such that $y^2=x$.
	1) There exists a number $x\geq 0$, such that for all numbers $y$, $y^2\neq x$.
4) *There is at least one number $a$ in \[0, 1\] such that the derivative of $x^3$ at $x=a$ is $0$.
	1) There is not a number $a$ in \[0,1\] such that the derivative of $x^3$ at $x=a$ is not $0$.
