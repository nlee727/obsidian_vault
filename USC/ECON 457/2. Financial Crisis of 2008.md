Fed response to high-tech bubble of 2000-2002 was an aggressive reduction in interest rates.
- T-bill rates dropped between 2001-2004
- Recession was mild and bried

Historic boom in housing market resulted from a stable economy and dramatically reduced interest rates
- Greater tolerance for risk, such as securitized mortgages.

Old:
- Mortgage loans came from a local lender - neighborhood savings bank/credit union
- Banks would hold them on their books
- Main liability were depositors accounts
New:
- Securitization: Pooling of loans into standardized securities backed by those loans traded like any other security
- Sell to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (to facilitate mortgage lending)
### Changes in Housing Finance
Conforming mortgages pooled almost entirely through Freddie Mac and Fannie Me
- Low-risk requiring demonstration of ability to repay loan

New product resulting from securitization model
- Securitization by private firms on nonconforming "subprime" loans with higher default risk
- Trend towards low and no documentation loans
- No income verification

### Mortgage Derivatives
Collateralized debt obligations (CDO)
Concentrates the credit risk of a bundle of loans on one class of investors; the other pooled investors are relatively protected from that risk

Prioritization of claims on loan repayments by dividing the pool into tranches
- Senior tranches - first claim on repayments from the entire pool
- Junior trances - paid only after the senior tranches
Credit rating significantly underestimated credit risk

### Credit Default Swap
A CDS is an insurance contract against the default of one of more borrowers
- Purchaser of the swap pays an annual premium for protection from credit risk
- Investors bought CDS to insure safety against subprime loans
- Some swap issuers did not have enough capital to back their CDS
    - AIG sold more than $400 billion of CDS contracts on subprime mortgages
