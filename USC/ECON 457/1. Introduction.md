### Real Assets vs. Financial Assets
- Real
    - Produce goods and services
    - Tangible/intangible
    - Innate productive capacity
    - Examples: Buildings, land, machines, IP
- Financial
    - Claims to income generated by real assets or government
    - Do not directly contribute to productive capacity of economy
    - Examples: Stocks, Bonds

### Types of Financial Assets
1. Fixed Income/Bonds (primary)
2. Equity
3. Derivatives
## Investment Process
Asset Allocation
- Choice among broad asset classes
Security Selection
- Choice of securities within each asset class

**Security analysis** involves valuation of particular securities that might be included in the portfolio
"Top down" approach - asset allocation first followed by security selection
- Macro opinions, interest rates, inflation, growth, etc.
"Bottom-up" approach - best value securities without as much concern for asset allocation

## Markets are Competitive
**Risk-return trade-off**: Higher-risk assets are prices to offer higher expected returns than lower-risk assets.

#### Passive Management
- Highly diversified portfolio, no attempt to select securities

#### Active Management
- Find mispriced securities by timing performance of broad asset classes
