## Money Market Securities
Tend to be more conservative, liquid, and low returning
### T-bills
- Over 1 year - bond
- Under 1 year - treasury bill
### Certificates of Deposit
- Bank pays interest and principal to the depositor at maturity
- Cannot be withdrawn on demand (penalty)
- FDIC insured
### Commercial Paper
- Short-term unsecured debt notes issued by companies that need to raise capital
- Maturity: Up to 270 days, typically 1 month or less
### Bankers Acceptance 
- An order to a bank by a customer to pay a sum of money at a future date
### Repurchase agreements (REPO)
- Short term, often overnight sales of securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a slightly higher price
- Term Repo: term of the implicit loan can be 30 days or more
- Reverse Repo: dealer buys government securities from investor, agreeing to sell them back on a future date
- Backed by explicit collateral (usually government bonds)
### Federal Funds
Commercial banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their deposits at the fed, and they can lend to each other at the fed funds rate
- Funds in a bank's reserve account at the federal reserve
- Loans arranged at federal funds rate

## LIBOR and its Replacement
### London Interbank Offer Rank (LIBOR)
- Was the premier European money market interest rate
- Determined based on surveys of rates reported by participating banks **not** actual transactions
    - Was the benchmark interest rate to which loans were based (Home loan is LIBOR + 3%)
- 2012 scandal -> regulators phased out LIBOR by 2021
### Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
- Rate on overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by Treasury securities
- Replaced LIBOR in the US 
- Overnight funding rate on repo loans that are backed by treasury securities
- Advantages over LIBOR
    - Rate calculated by actual loans/transactions
    - It is a secured rate (backed by treasuries)
- A very low rate - main benchmark of overnight lending rate

## Yields on Money Market Instruments
Lowest risk spectrum on the investment landscape. High quality short term assets. Money Market funds are mutual funds that invest in money market instruments.
- Government funds hold short-term U.S. Treasury or agency securities
    - Keep their NAV at $1 and manipulating the payout so that it stays at $1
- Prime funds also hold other money market instruments

## The Bond Market
Longer-term borrowing or debt instruments than those that trade in the money market.
- Treasury notes and bonds
- Corporate bonds
- Municipal Bonds
- Mortgage securities
- Federal agency debt
    - Fannie and Freddie Mac are agencies of the government, but they must issue bonds to fund their operations through federal agency debt
    - Tend to trade almost like treasuries

## Debt instruments
### Treasury notes and bonds
U.S. government borrows funds in large by selling notes and bonds
- Notes - up to 10 years
- Bonds - 10-30 years
### Inflation-protected treasury bonds
- Government-issues bonds linked to a cost of living index
- Provide citizens an effective hedge against inflation risk 
- TIPS

### Municipal Bonds
Tax-exempt bonds issues by state and local governments
- General Bonds (GO)
    - Lower risk, backed by the full taxing authority of the entity
- Revenue Bonds
    - Backed by the specific revenue of a certain project
Compare after-tax returns on each bond
$$
r_{{\text{taxable}}} \times(1-t) > r_{\text{muni}}
$$
Taxable bond gives a higher return; otherwise, the municipal bond is preferred.

## Debt Instruments
### Corporate Bonds
Private firms borrow money directly from public
- Secured bonds: specific collateral backed
- Unsecured bonds: debenture (backed by general assets)
- Subordinated debentures: lower priority debenture

Usually pay semiannual coupons, return face value to bondholder at maturity, larger default risk than treasury-issues securities
- May come with options attached

        - Issuer has option to repurchase at call price
    - Convertible
        - Issuer has option to convert to shares
