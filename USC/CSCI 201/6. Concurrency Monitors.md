### Motivation for Synchronization
Thread synchronization is used to coordinate the execution of dependent threads
Shares resources pose problem to multi-threaded code since we don't typically have control over when a thread will be switched into and out of the CPU.

- If a variable is declared static, all instances share the same variables.


### Monitor Overview
- An object with mutual exclusion and synchronization capabilities
- A thread enters the synchronized block by acquiring the monitor on it and exits by releasing the monitor
