### Thread Methods
```Java
tc.join();
```
- Allows one thread to specify that it wants to wait for another thread to complete before it continues to execute
I want to wait until the thread is completed
- It will block the main thread until tc is executed
```Java
Thread.yield();
```
- Gives up running state to ready
#### Executors Class
- Provides factory and utility methods got getting ExecutorService object
- When executor is terminated, it means none of the threads are running.
- shutdownNow() will inturrupt and die.


### Thread Priorities
setPriority(int) and getPriority()

Priorities are given values from 1 to 10
- Thread.MIN_PRIORITY is 1
- Thread.NORM_PRIORITY is 5
    - Default priority
- Thread.MAX_PRIORITY is 10

When the JVM decides on the next thread to execute from the ready state, it follows a probabilistic algorithm
- Thread with a priority of 10 is twice as likely to be chosen as a thread with priority of 5
- JVM chooses a random int from the sum of the priorities

I want MAX.PRIORITY to start and end first
