``` Java
public static voic main(String [] args) {
    System.out.println(new File(".").getAbsoluteFile()); //Current directory
    System.out.print("What file?");
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
}
```
## Inheritance, Abstract Classes & Interfaces, Polymorphism
### Inheritance
- Build a major concept then add specifics

Java supports single inheritance, allows a derived class to inherit from only one base class
C++ allows multiple inheritance, e.g.
``` C++
class IPhone : public Telephone, public Email_Reader {
    public:
        void buy_app(){
        //...
        }
};

void main(){
    IPhone ip;
    ip.Telephone::send_email();
    ip.Email_Reader::send_email();
}
```
can invoke implementations of methods

#### Inheritance vs Composition
is-a Relationship (Inheritance)
- Vehicle - Car, Truck, Motorcycle
has-a Relationship (Composition)
- Car - Steering Wheel, Brake Pedal
``` Java
class Car {
    SteeringWheel sw;
    BrakePedal bp;
    Speedometer sp;
}
```

#### Instantiating a Child Class
- Keyword *extends* follows the name of the class, followed by the name of the parent class
- When a child is instantiated, parent class must be instantiated first in the child class's constructor
    - Will happen automatically unless we explicitly instantiate the parent
- When we call the parent's constructor from the child, it must be the first line of code in the child class's constructor
- Unlike properties and methods, constructors of a parent are not inherited by the child
- Parent constructors can be only invoked by child constructors using *super*.
``` Java
public class Shape {
    protected char name;
    public SHape(char n) {
        name = n;
    }
}
```

##### Inheritance Example
``` Java
Class Parent {
    private int num;
    public Parent(int num){
        this.num = num;
    }
    public int meth() {
        return num;
    }
}

public class Child extends Parent{
    public Child(){
        super(10); //required
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Child c = new Child();
        System.out.println(c.meth)
    }
}
)
```
No constructor in Parent that takes no parameters (Calls super(); in the child constructor)

All variables get initialized in Java
int = 0
string = ""
bool = False

### Abstract Classes
- Guarantees a child has an implementation for a specific method
- Abstract methods only contain declarations but no implementations
    - If any class contains an abstract method the class must be declared abstract
- Abstract classes cant be instantiated (Cannot use "new")
- A class that inherits must provide implementations for all abstract methods
``` Java
abstract class Parent() {
    public abstract int meth1();
    public int meth2() {
        return 10;
        }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public int meth1() {
    return 20;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
    Child c = new Child();
    System.out.println(c.meth1());
    System.out.println(c.meth2());
    Parent p = new Parent(); //Syntax error because parent is abstract
    }
}
```

``` Java
public class Test{
    public void foo(Parent p) {
        System.out.println(p.meth1());
        System.out.println(p.meth2());
    }
}
```

### Interfaces
- Allows to derive a class from multiple classes
- In C++, the parent classes have implementations. With interfaces, they have no implementation. They must be in the child.

#### Interface example
``` Java
interface Parent{
    public int meth1();
}

abstract class Child implements Parent {
    public abstract int meth2();
    public int meth1() {
    return 20;
    }
}

class GrandChild extends Child {
    public int meth2(){
    return 30;
    }
}
```

## Polymorphism
#### Compile Time polymorphism
- Method Overloading - when a method behaves differently based on the number or type of arguments (Resolved at compile time)
```Java
class Print {

    void show(int x){
        System.out.println("asdas)
    }

    void show(double x){
        System.out.println("double")
    }
}
```
#### Run-Time Polymorphism
- Method Overriding - When a subclass overrides a method of its superclass and provides its own implementation. Same method call behaves differently depending on the object that invokes the method (resolved at runtime)
```Java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal")
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal{
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog")
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal{
    @Override
    void sound(){
        System.out.println("Cat")
    }
}
```
