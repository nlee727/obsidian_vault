### Thread Overview
Multiple processors, multiple cores, and hyper threading will determining the actual number of processes running.

#### Programs vs Processes vs Threads
Programs
- An executable file residing in memory, typically in secondary storage
Processes
- An executing instance of a program
- "Task"
Threads
- Any section of code within a process that can execute what appears to be simultaneous
- Shares the same resources allotted to the process by the OS kernel

Round Robin - CPU continuously go through threads.
- May not work and waste time when waiting for user input

### Multi-Threaded Programming
- Appears to be simultaneous execution in a single core
- Purpose is to add functionality to your program

### Parallel Programming
- Simultaneous execution in different cores or different CPUs with a shared memory space
- Purpose is to speed up execution by using redundant resources on your computer
    - Multiple CPUs, multiple cores

### Distributed Programming (Cloud)
- Multiple sections executing on multiple CPUs with different memory spaces (could be located on different computers)
- Purpose is to speed up execution using resources typically on other computers


#### Thread Details
- OS will switch processes and native threads into and out of the CPU (time slicing)
    - In Java, the JVM switches threads into and out of the CPU, and the OS switches the JVM into and out of the CPU
- Time slicing is efficient because the CPU sits idle a lot of the time
    - Waiting on user input
- All Java programs have two threads
    - Main and Garbage Collector

### Creating a Thread
- Implement the Runnable interface, pass it to an instance of a thread, and start the thread
    - Runnable is in java.lang,
    - If the class is used, only one can be inherited, which is why interfaces are used
- Extend the Thread class (implements the Runnable interface), and start the thread
    - Thread is in java.lang

- In either of the above cases
    - Call the start() method on the thread class to kick off the new thread
    - Override the public void run() method in your new class
        - run() method will be called when start() is called on your thread
    - If you call run(), it will execute as if you just called a method, not using multi-threading
