## Garbage Collection, Exception Handling, Serialization, Generics
### Garbage Collection
- Looks at memory and identifies which locations are still referenced by variables
    - A memory location is a candidate or garbage collection when it no longer is referenced by any part of the program
- 2 threads must be running at a minimum, one for the program and one for the garbage collector

- Anything declared static will not be garbage collected until the program ends

#### Step 1 - Marking
#### Step 2 - Normal Deletion
- Garbage collector removes unreferenced objects leaving referenced objects and pointers to free space
#### Step 2a - Deletion with Compacting
- Deleted unreferenced objects and compacts the remaining referenced objects

#### Invoking Garbage Collection
- Programmers cant explicitly invoke gc
- make a suggestion to the JVM to run the garbage collector with 
``` Java 
System.gc();
```

### Exception Handling
- An exception is an indication of a problem that occurs during a program's execution
    - Should not be part of the normal execution of a program
    - 10 times slower compared to writing good code to avoid an exception
- Handle errors that would cause our programs to terminate prematurely using exception handling

#### try-catch blocks
- Enclose potential blocks of code in "try"
- Immediately following a try block are zero or more catch blocks
    - Exception parameter that represents the type of exception the catch handler can process immediately after the catch
    - Exception parameter includes the variable name representing the exception being handles
- An optional finally clause can be included after all the catch blocks
    - Will be executed regardless
