### Domain Name System
www is a hostname
usc.edu is the domain name
- To find the IP address of a hostname/domain name combination run *ping* or *nslookup* from a terminal.

### DNS namespace
- Hostname/domain combination will be mapped to an IP address through DNS servers.
    - DNS is a hierarchical domain-based naming scheme implemented through a distributed database system for implementing.

### Public and Private IP Addresses
- Public IP addresses are able to be seen by any computer in the world and required for communicating on the internet
- Private IP are secured behind a firewall
- As you increase the number of networks, you decrease the number of hosts

Private IPv4 are classified into 3 classes
- Class A 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    - 2^0 network with 2^24 addresses
- Class B 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    - 2^4 networks with 2^16 addresses
- Class C 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
    - 2^8 networks with 2^8 hosts on each network

Private IP addresses cannot communicate outside local networks, must use NAT if accessing Internet
IPv6 doesn't have a need for private IP addresses, but can still use if desired

### NAT (Network Address Translating/ IP Masquerading)
- NAT servers substitutes its own public IP address in place of the computer's private IP address

### Subnets
Router needs a subnet mask that indicates the split between the network/subnet combination and the host
A subnet mask will consist of all 1s followed by all 0s
can represent the number of 1s by 255.255.255.0 or /24

- Number of hosts is the last bits of zeros minus 2 (for all 1s and all 0s)
- Number of subnets is the number of 1s taken from the class (Class A takes the first 8 bits so this has 18 bits left 2^18 subnets)

#### Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)
Used for a computer or router to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration (gateway and subnet mask) to computers on the network
- Can be public/private
- Most routers assign private IP addresses such as 192.168.1.101
- Routers often have DHCP built into them.
