### Explicitly Acquiring Locks
- A synchronized methocd or block of code implicitly acquires a lock (explicilty acquiring a monitor) on the isntance before executing
- Java gives us the ability to explicitly acquire locks using the 
    - java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock interface and
    - java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock class

### Reentrant Locks
A reentrant lock is a lock that does not need to be acquired more than once if entering a second critical section on the same lock


### Thread Condition Issues
- Once a thread invokes await() on a condition, the thread will move to the waiting state until it is signaled
