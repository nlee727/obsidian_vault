### Semaphores
Semaphores control access to shared resources by allowing a certain number of threads to acquire permits, preventing more than a set number of threads from accessing the resource simultaneously
- The ability to switch threads concurrently allows for greater functionality

- Semaphores can restrict the number of threads that access a shared resource
    - Unlike a lock or monitor, the number of permits available on a semaphore is specified at creation and can be more than one

There is no reason to use locks without conditions because they are effectively a monitor
- In this case, you can do things that you cannot do with monitors since they don't have conditions

##### Example
- Multi-player games that only allow a certain number of simultaneous users
- Producer-Consumer problem could use semaphores instead of blocking queues
- Simulating a factory building computers with a finite number of components where each computer needs a certain number of each component

If you only allow 1 semaphore it is the same as using locks with no conditions and therefore just a monitor
