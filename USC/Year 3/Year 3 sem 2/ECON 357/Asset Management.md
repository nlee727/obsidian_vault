Tradeoff between returns and liquidity for banks
#### Liability Management
- Raising Funds
    - Banks can short term borrow from other banks, managing liabilities (such as selling negotiable CDs) and participating in the money market. Fund raising through deposits has decreased

#### Capital Adequacy Management
##### Bank A
**Assets**
- Reserves - 10m
- Loans - 90m
**Liabilities**
- Checkable Deposit - 90m
- Bank Capital - 10m
##### Bank B
**Assets**
- Reserves - 10m
- Loans - 90m
**Liabilities**
- Checkable Deposit - 96m
- Bank Capital - 4m

Interest on Reserves - 4%
Interest on Loans - 8%

##### Bank A
$$
0.04 \times 10 + 0.08 \times 90 = 0.4 + 7.2 = 7.6
$$
$$
\text{Return on Assets }=\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Total Assets}}=\frac{7.6}{100}=7.6\%
$$
$$
\text{Return on Equity }=\frac{7.6}{10}=76\%
$$
##### Bank B
$$
\text{Return on Equity }=\frac{7.6}{4}=190\%
$$
#### Return on Equity
$$
\text{ROE }=\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Equity}} \times \frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Assets}}=\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Assets}} \times \frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Equity}}
$$
$$
\text{Equity Multiplier (EM)}=\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Equity}}
$$
$$
\text{ROE} = \text{ROA} \times \text{EM}
$$

#### New Scenario
##### Bank A
**Assets**
- Reserves - 10m
- Loans - *85m*
**Liabilities**
- Checkable Deposit - 90m
- Bank Capital - *5m*
##### Bank B (Failure)
Higher level of risk due to a higher return on equity
**Assets**
- Reserves - 10m
- Loans - *85m*
**Liabilities**
- Checkable Deposit - 96m
- Bank Capital - *-1m*

The amount of capital affects returns for the equity holders of the bank

- Choice of how much capital they need depends on the state of the economy and levels of confidence
- If they want to increase the EM
    - Reduce Equity (paying dividends, stock buybacks)
    - Increase Assets (Borrow funds to first increase reserves and buy securities)

### Managing Credit Risk
Banks want long term relationships with the customer
- More likely to do what the bank wants them to do even if its not in the contract
- compensating balances also help the bank collect information
- Credit Rationing
    - Lend less than what the borrower is asking for, or not at all
-
