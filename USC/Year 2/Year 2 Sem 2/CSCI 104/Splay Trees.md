Another map/set implementation (storing keys or key/value pairs)
- Insert, Remove, Find in O(n)

They guarantee that if you do m operations on a splay tree with n elements that the total time is $O(m\cdot \log(n))$
and amortized time is $O(\log(n)$

- The recently accessed element will be near the top of the tree
