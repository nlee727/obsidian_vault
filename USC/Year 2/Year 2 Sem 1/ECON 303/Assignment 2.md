##### Question 3
$L^aK^b$
if $a+b=1$, constant returns, $a+b<1$ decreasing returns, $a+b>1$, increasing returns


##### Question 4
$$
\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}
$$
represents a firms internal ability to substitute labor and capital

if this value is less than the price ratio, then sell labor and buy more capital if labor is on the x axis


##### Question 4/5
$$
\frac{MP_{L}}{w}=\frac{MP_{K}}{r}
$$
Marginal product per dollar must be equalized for the inputs

##### Question 6
No entry barriers cause long run profits to equal zero

##### Question 7
$$
\frac{MP_{K}}{MP_{L}}=\frac{r}{w}
$$
