$$
Q_{d}(P,P_{\text{rel}},I,\mathbb{P})
$$
Representing $\mathbb{P}$ in a mathematical way
- The consumer is guided by $\mathbb{P}$, constrained by $P,P_{\text{rel}},I$

##### Assumptions
1. Only two goods $x,y$
	1. If you want to find demand for $x$, just treat $y$ as the composite good (all other goods)
	2. $Q_{d}^x(P_{x},P_{y},I,\mathbb{P)}$
2. $P_{x},P_{y},I$ are exogenous
	1. Fixed for the consumer at the moment, but not for the modeler. We can see the effect of change in these variables
##### Axioms of Rational Choice
Pertain to $\mathbb{P}$ specifically. 
Preferences are:
1. Complete
	1. For any 2 bundles $A,B$ of goods $x,y$, either $A \succ B$ or $A \prec B$ or $A\sim B$
	2. "Smart Enough", can rank goods
2. Transitive
	1. For any 3 bundles $A,B,C$ of goods $x,y$ if $A\succ B\cap B\succ C$, then $A\succ C$
	2. "Reasonably consistent"
3. Non-satiated
	1. More $\succ$ Less



$U(x,y)$ - the utility function
- Describes the relationship between what consumers actually consume and their level of well-being
- Since utility functions can be represented in different ratios, the significance of the actual score is of little importance, rather the ordering is what really matters.
- This also implies that interpersonal utility comparisons cannot be done

$$
U(x,y)=X^\alpha Y^\beta |\alpha+\beta=1
$$
Cobb-Douglas form will be the easiest to work with
$$
\alpha=\frac{a}{a+b},\beta=\frac{b}{a+b}
$$

The marginal rate of substitution tells us two things
1. A complete ordering ordering of all bundles
2. A consumer's personal/subjective willingness to substitute goods $x,y$


$I = P_{x}x+P_{y}y$
$$
y=\frac{I}{P_{y}}-\frac{P_{x}}{P_{y}}x
$$
- Slope of the price constraint is simply the price ratio

1. Anything created in this line represents the set of affordable goods
2. The objective rate at which goods $x,y$ can always be traded in markets.
