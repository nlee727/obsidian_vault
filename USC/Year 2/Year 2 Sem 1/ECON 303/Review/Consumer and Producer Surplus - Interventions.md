#### Price Floor
Price floor will lead to an excess supply

There may be an additional cost to society, $D$, which is the cost of unsold goods.

$$
\Delta TS=-B-C-D
$$
Governments may utilize a **price support**, which is the promise to buy the excess supply at the given price floor

- If this is the case, the producer surplus increases by $E$, the excess supply
$$
\Delta PS=A+B+E
$$

$$
\Delta G = -B-C-D-E
$$
$$
\Delta TS^` = -B-C-D
$$
- D is also the taxpayer burden

#### Production Quota
Supply would become vertical at the given quantity
$$
\Delta CS = -A-B
$$
$$
\Delta PS = +A-C+B+C+E
$$
Producers will not agree to restrict quantity, and other producers need to be paid to prevent them from participating in the market and gaining surplus created by the quota. BCE is the incentive payment.
$$
\Delta TS = +E
$$
This method avoids the extra cost to the sellers
$$
\Delta G = -B-C-E
$$
#### Tax
$$
Q_{d}(P_{B})=Q_{S}(P_{s})
$$

#### Subsidy
$$
P_{B}+S=P_{S}
$$
The expansion in consumer surplus is over and above what was already sitting there. There is no transfer the producer surplus.
- Essentially the opposite of a tax
