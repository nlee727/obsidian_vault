**Market** is the collection of buyers and sellers that, through their actual or potential interactions, determine the price of a produce or set of products.
- Includes more than an industry - a collection of firms that sell the same or closely related products - which in fact is just the supply side of the market.

### Definition
**Demand**: Quantities of a good/service that buyers are willing and able to buy at all possible prices.
$$
Q_{d}(P,P_{\text{rel}}, I, \text{number of buyers}, \text{expectations}, t,\text{demographics},\dots)
$$
$$
 =Q_{d}(P,P_{\text{rel}}, I, \mathbb{P}\text{(preference ordering}))
$$
$$
=-b_{1}P+b_{2}I+b_{3}P_{\text{sub}}-b_{4}P_{\text{comp}}
$$
ceteris peribus from $b_{2},b_{3},\dots$ leads to $$
A-bP
$$
Graphing the demand function solved for price$$
P=\frac{A}{b}-\frac{1}{b}Q_{d}
$$
$-b$ is the slope of the demand curve

Increase in income would shift the curve to the right

**Supply**: Quantities of a good/service that sellers are willing and able to sell at all possible prices.
$$
Q_{s}=(P,P_{\text{labor}},P_{\text{capital}},\text{technology},P_{\text{land},}t, \dots)
$$
$$
=Q_{s}(P,\text{costs})
$$
costs
1. Wage rate
2. Rental rate
3. Technology
$$
+d_{1}P-d_{2}w-d_{4}r+d_{4}T
$$
ceteris peribus of costs leads to
$$
C+d_{1}P
$$

cheaper labor would shift the supply curve to the right

#### Four Key Assumptions
1. Supply and demand in a single market
2. All goods are identical
3. All goods are sold for the same price, everyone has seen the same information
4. There are many producers and consumers in the market

**Equilibrium**
- Steady
- Balance
- No change
- Stable, forces canceling

#### Excess Supply
Creates a downward pressure for the price
#### Excess Demand
Creates an upward pressure for the price

### Determinants
##### Example
Earthquake in Northern California

Supply will shift left as wages will increase, cost of production will increase, less houses, etc.

Demand will shift left as insurance premiums may go up, houses will become less desirable, etc.

We know that equilibrium quantity will fall, but resulting price is indeterminate. If demand contracts greater than the supply, the price will increase.

##### Example
Incoming hurricane and gas

Supply will decrease and Demand will increase

Price will go up but quantity demanded will be ambiguous
