$$
Q_{s}=(P,\text{COSTS})
$$
COSTS includes wage rate, rental rate, and technology

Technology essentially determines how wage rate (labor) and rental rate (capital) are combined


#### Assumptions
Firms choose the cost minimizing choice of $L,K$ for all $q

**Short Run**: is defined as the period of time in which one or more inputs used cannot be changed
**Long Run**: is defined when all inputs in production can be changed

$MP_{L} >0$
$MP_{K}>0$

#### Long Run
