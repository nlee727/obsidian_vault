## Etruscans
- Little literature, instead look for archeological evidence
- Romans also had Etruscan Kings at the beginning
- Eventually became assimilated into Roman society
- Height of the Etruscan society coincides with the archaic period of Greece

#### Etruscan Tombs at Caere - Called Necropolis

- Also had rock-cut tombs cut into the face of cliffs 
##### Tomb of the Reliefs at Care - 500BC
