#### Temple of Zeus at Olympia 460BC
Doric Temple

Made with Shelly Limestone
- Cult image of Zeus was taken to Constantinople by Christians

Twice as long as it is wide and approached by the east by a ramp
The temple of Hera II at Paestum gives a good example of what the Temple of Zeus what have looked like

#### Temple of Athena (Parthenon)
Doric Building, but contains ionic column within the interior (column with a base)

Athens's large prominence in the Greek world symbolically explains why they combine the two orders.



Temples contained a convex platform and the column's positions to compensate for the optical illusion of vertical lines from a distance showing outward.


#### Erechtheum 430-400BC
Not a usual rectangular temple, but 3 buildings under 1 roof.
Served as holy places for specific divinities
##### Caryatid Figures - Porch of Maidens
Women that hole up the east side of the Erechtheum


#### Early Archaic Kouros 600 BC
Over time, generally see a transition into a more naturalistic form

Bronze was the preferred medium for 3 dimensional structures in the classical period because they were recyclable and had high tensile strength.

## Early Classical Sculpture
#### Kritios Boy 480BC
Named after the sculpture who made it
May be a youthful thesius

Tilts slightly to the side and the hips are tilted to match the front foot
No more archaic smile. Instead the face is expressionless.

#### Riace Bronzes
Found in a shipwreck. Warrior A and B.
Bronze casting in part and then later added.
May have been part of cargo from a Roman Ship after the conquest of Greece

Not many bronze statues, they are exemplary works of bronze statues from this period

What is the difference between archaic and classical cult images in temples?

How is the erectheon an exception to rectilinear Greek temple?
- It is not rectilinear, roofs are of different heights
