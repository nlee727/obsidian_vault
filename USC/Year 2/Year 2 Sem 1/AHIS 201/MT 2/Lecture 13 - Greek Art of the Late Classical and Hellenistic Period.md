#### Athena Panel, Great Altar of Zeus
Distortion of Anatomical Structure

#### Laokoon Group Sculpture
Represents the legendary trojan priest being attacked by snakes sent by the goddess Athena
Greatly influenced the art of the renaissance like Michelangelo

By adding another person (3 people), it makes the sculpture more planar, which contributes to the theory that the original only contained 2 figures

#### Venus de Milo = Aphroditte of Melos
Alexander of Antioch 80 BC
Late Hellenistic reinterpretation of an old classical type
Adaptations of original greek works that are lost to us

### Portraiture
Likeness of a named historical individual, became an important medium of Greek Art

Prior to the late classical, people were displayed in a very idealized way
- Portrait of Pericles
    - Face is mask-like

The individual represented was conceived like a figure

Eventually became more individualized
- Small Ivory Heads
    - Alexander the Great
Such portraits were a blend of realism and idealism

##### Hellenistic
Portraiture reached a new height
- Statue of Demosthenes
Full body

Using various models to make something new.

### Architecture and Urban Planning
The architecture showed an increasing interest in developing the interior place of the temple for cult images of the gods.

Continued through the late classical and Hellenistic periods

#### Temple of Asklepios at Epidauros 350
 Corinthian Capital is mainly employed for interior decorations
 - Very rare to find a Corinthian capital outside 

Proskenion (stage) for theaters are a hellenistic development
