### Geometric Period - Dark Ages 1000 - 700 BC
No historical records, so it is incredibly difficult for historians to reconstruct from before 500 BC.

Rely on a relative chronology based off of identifying stratified layers of the earth.
Items found in the same stratified layers as identifiable objects

#### Geometric Graves in the Kerameikos
Gift offerings deep inside of the grave along with their cremated remains.

The practice of cremation could be a result of battles or plagues where so many died that they had to dispose of large amounts of bodies.

#### Geometric Terracotta Models in Form of Temples 800 BC

### Orientalizing Period 700-600 BC
Increasing trade allowed
Phoenicians dominated the sea trade until this time.
The Greeks successfully ousted the Phoenicians as the chief traders in the Mediterranean, setting up colonies.

#### Blinding of Polyphemos
Eleusis Amphora 650 BC - a tale in the odyssey, one of the earliest representations

#### Lady of Auxerre (Louvre, Paris) 650 BC

Made out of mudbrick or wood, so only the foundations remain
contained a cult statue


What do we call Greek geometric period?
- Dark ages
When is this period?
- 1000 - 700
Stratigraphy
- Stratified layers are the oldest, with the exceptions of disturbances
What is the importance of stratigraphy?
- Allows to establish a chronology which is largely stylistic based on finds from other objects in the same stratified layers
What artistic medium provides the best evidence for dating based off style?
- Painted vessels/pottery
Why is Athens so important in this period (athenocentric view of greek art)
- Geometric style flowered in Athens due to Athens being undisturbed from the Phoenecians
What is the Greek polis?
- Citystate, starts to come about during the Orientalizing period
What distinguishes Orientalizing from the geometric period?
- Rectaliniear angles, simple abstract shapes - geometric
- Shaped become more like human bodies
