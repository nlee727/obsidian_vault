#### Motivation:
Graphical methods give a quick feel and can be very accurate at predicting long-term behavior, e.g. in the presence of funnels

Numerical methods are usually the best option for when medium range solutions must be known accurately, and when the equation cannot be solved exactly

##### Initial Value Problem
$$
y'=f(x,y)
$$
$$
y(x_{o})=y_{o}
$$
## Euler's Method
Choose a uniform step size, $h$, and continue the solution, recalculating the slope once $h$ is traveled

$$
y_{n+1}-y_{n}=hA_{n}
$$
#### Euler Equations
$$
x_{n+1}=x_{n}+h
$$
$$
y_{n+1}=y_{n}+hA_{n}
$$
$$
A_{n}=f(x_{n},y_{n})
$$
The resulting line segments are called "Euler Struts" and their union the Euler Polygon. It is an approximation to the integral curve $y=y(x)$.

##### Error
If it were a line, Euler would be exactly right
- Underestimation for convex solution curves 
	- $y''>0$
- Overestimation for concave solution curves
	-  $y''<0$
Generally, check the second derivative at the starting point

- The error $e$ depends on step size

Euler first-order method
$$
e\approx c_{1}h
$$
halve the step size, halve the error (generally)

## Better Methods
To find a better value for $A_{n}$

### Improved Euler, Heun's, Modified Euler, RK2
$$
x_{n+1}=x_{n}+h
$$
$$
y_{n+1}=y_{n}+h\left( \frac{{A_{n}+B_{n}}}{2} \right)
$$
$$
\dot{y_{n+1}}=y_{n}+hA_{n}
$$
$$
B_{n}=f(x_{n+1},\dot{y_{n+1}})
$$
Second-order method, meaning 
$$
e\approx c_{2}h^2
$$
halve the step size, quarter the error

- What determines runtime of this is how many times the slope is calculated, since it is the hardest step.
### Runge-Kutta 4th order-method RK4
Standard Method, accurate
$$
\frac{{A_{n}+2B_{n}+2C_{n}+2D_{n}}}{6}
$$
#### Pitfalls of Numerical Computation
1. 
2. 
##### Example:
$$
y'=y^2
$$
Solutions:
$$
y=\frac{1}{c-x}
$$
contains a singularity at $x=c$, which cannot be predicted by the differential equations
