$$
a(x)y'+b(x)y=c(x)
$$
- Linear in $y$ and $y'$. $ay_{1}+by_{2}=c$
### Standard **Linear** Form
$$
y'+p(x)y=q(x)
$$
**NOT** $y'=p(x)y+q(x)$

###### Remark
They can always be solved

##### Model Examples
- **Temperature-concentration**
- Mixing
- Radioactive decay, bank interest
- Some motion problems

#### Conduction Model
$T$ represents the temperature of the object
$T_{e}$ represents the environment temperature
$t$ = time

##### Newton's Cooling Law
$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T_{e}-T)
$$
$k>0$, the conductivity constant
$T(0)=T_{0}$

#### Diffusion Model
$C$ represents concentration inside
$C_{e}$ represents concentration outside
(semi-permeable membrane wall)
$$
\frac{dC}{dt}=k(C_{e}-C)
$$
likewise, $k>0$
