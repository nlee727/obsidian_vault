### First Order ODEs
$$
y'=f(x,y)
$$
###### Examples
$y'=\frac{x}{y}$
$y'=x-y^2$ (unsolvable)
$y'=x^2-y$


## Geometric View of ODEs
#### Analytic vs Geometric
$$
y'=f(x,y) \leftrightarrow \text{Direction Field}
$$
$$
y_{1}(x) \text{ (a solution)} \leftrightarrow \text{Integral Curve}
$$
 - The integral curve will have the direction of the field at all points.
##### Theorem
$$
y_{1}(x) \text{ a soln. to } y'=f(x,y) \iff \text{graph of } y_{1}(x) \text{ is an integral curve}
$$
*of the direction field associated with the equation*

###### Remarks, both are the same statement
1. $y_{1}(x) \text{ a soln. to } y'=f(x,y)$
means:
$$
y'(x)=f(x,y_{1}(x))
$$
2. $\text{graph of } y_{1}(x) \text{ is the integral curve}$
means:
$$\text{slope of } y_{1}(x) = \text{slope of direction field } f(x, y_{1}(x))$$
#### Drawing a Direction Field
Computer
1. Pick $(x,y)$ that are equally spaces
2. $f(x,y)$ - find slope
3. Draws Slope
Human
1. Pick slope $C$
2. $f(x,y)=C$ plot isocline represented by dashed lines
3. Draw all slopes $C$ on the isocline

##### Isocline
Get differential equation in terms of y

###### Example
$$
y'=\frac{-x}{y}
$$
$$
\frac{-x}{y} = C
$$
$$
y = \frac{{-1}}{C}x
$$
