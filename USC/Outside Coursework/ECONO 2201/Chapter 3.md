## Demand
#### Definition of Demand
 - Demand is the amount of the good that buyers are **willing and able to purchase** at a given price
 
#### Demand Schedule and Quantity Demanded
Quantity Demand: When price changes, it changes quantity demanded

Demand schedule: A table that shows the relationship between price and QD. When graphed, it is described as the **demand curve**

#### Market Demand
The demand curve that represents the population who acts in the same way as a specific person and his QD

#### Determinants of Demand
- Income of consumers
	- Increase in income increases demand of normal goods
	- Decreases demand of inferior goods
- Prices of related goods
	- Increase in price of related goods increases demand if products are substitutes.
		- Big mac and whopper
	- Decrease in demand if products are complements
		- Big mac and fries
- Tastes
- Population and demographics
	- Increase in population increases demand
- Expected future prices
	- If someone says housing prices will go up, demand will increase
	- Future products are substitutes for current products

#### The Law of Demand
Ceteris Paribus, if the price of an object increases, the quantity demanded decreases

##### Why?
When the price decreases,
- Substitution Effect
	- The product has become cheaper relative to other goods, so consumers substitute toward it. 
- Income Effect
	- The consumer now has greater purchasing power and elects to purchase more goods overall

Movement along the Demand Curve or changes in QD
Happens when price of a good changes ceteris paribus.

Shifts in the demand curve occur with any of the determinants of demand that shifts demand

**Substitute**: Goods and services that can be used for the same purpose

**Complements**: Goods and services that are used together
