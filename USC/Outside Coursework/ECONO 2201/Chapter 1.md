## Section 1.1 - Economic Assumptions
#### People are rational
**Rational**: Using all available information to achieve your goals

Rational consumers and firms weight the benefits and costs of each action and try to make the best decision possible.

#### People respond to incentives
People will do what incentives lead them to do
###### Example:
Does health insurance give the incentive to be obese?
- After controlling for all variables, people with health insurance were more obese

#### Optimal decisions are made at the margin
Marginal cost and marginal benefit: the additional cost or benefit associated with a small amount extra of some action

As long as the marginal benefit is larger than MC, you will continue to do the activity (up until they are equal)
## Section 1.2 - 3 Questions For Every Society
#### What goods and services will be produced?
We must choose a mixture, as increase of one good requires reduction of some other good, resulting from the scarcity of productive resources.

- Any product with the highest demand

#### How will the goods be produced?
Using more workers or machines
- Affects unemployment, capacity utilization rights, all things in the economy

- Least cost combination of inputs

#### Who will receive the goods and services?
Depends largely how income is distributed

- Consumers with highest ability to pay

### Types of economies
Centrally Planned Economy 
- Governments decide all 3 questions

Market Economy
- Decisions of household and firms determine the 3 questions
- Market demand and supply determine the 3 questions

Mixed Economy
- Most decisions are from the market, but governments play a significant role in the allocation of resources

### Efficiency of economies
Market economies tend to be more efficient, promoting

**Productive efficiency**: where goods or services are produced at the lowest possible cost.

**Allocative efficiency**: A state of the economy where production is consistent with consumer preferences. 
- MB =MC, Demand=Supply
- Producing a good that is not too expensive
- Every good/service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefits to society equal to the marginal cost of producing it.

#### Equity vs Efficiency
- Economically efficient outcomes may not be the most desirable as they result in high inequality.
- Equity is the fair distribution of economic benefits.
- Often a tradeoff between efficiency and equity.

## Section 1.3 - Economic Analysis
Building a model often follows these steps
1. Decide on the assumptions to use in developing the model
	1. Must be realistic and useful
2. Formulate a testable hypothesis
	1. Verifies or disproved using data
3. Use economic data to test the hypothesis
4. Revise the model if it fails to explain the data well
5. Retain the revised model to help similar questions in the future

#### Positive Analysis
- What is? and Cause and Effect
- Use economic models that can be verified with data
- Economists generally perform positive analysis, measuring the costs and benefits of different courses of action

#### Normative Analysis
- Usually follows positive analysis, answers the "what ought to be?"
- Based on value judgement
- You will usually see the word "Should"
- These can be debated, usually with other positive statements

## Section 1.4 - Distinguish Micro, Macro
**Microeconomics** study how households and firms make choices
How they interact in markets and how the government attempts to influence their choices

**Macroeconomics** is the study of the economy as a whole, including topics such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.

## Section 1.5 - Define important Economic Terms
**Technology**: The process a firm uses for turning inputs to outputs of goods and services
- Skills of managers and workers
- Productivity and efficiency of machines

**Capital**: Manufactured goods that are used to produce other goods and services
- Machinery, equipment, plants, trucks
- Economists differentiate between human and physical capital
