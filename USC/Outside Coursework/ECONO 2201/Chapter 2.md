## Section 2.1 - PPF and Opportunity Costs
A PPR is used to analyze opportunity costs and trade-offs

A **production possibilities frontier (PPF)** is a curve showing the maximum attainable combinations of two goods that can be produced with available resources and current technology
- Positive tool - shows "what is"

4 assumptions:
- 2 goods
- resources do not change
- technology remains unchanged
- efficient use of resources

##### Example: Tesla
Tesla can produce original models or new Model 3

- Points on the PPF are attainable for Tesla
- Points below the curve are inefficient
- Points above the curve are unattainable with current resources

Slope is the **opportunity cost**: The highest valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an activity

Too many cooks in the kitchen, payoff will be smaller to devoting additional resources to that activity

**Economic growth**: ability of the economy to increase the production of goods and services. Previously unattainable combinations are now possible

## Section 2.2 - Comparative Advantage and Trade
Comparative Advantage serves as the basis for trade

Parties benefit from trade by specializing in what they are relatively good at. 

**Absolute advantage**: The ability of an individual, a firm, or a country to produce more of a good or service than competitors, using the same amount of resources
**Comparative advantage**: The ability to produce a good a service at a lower opportunity cost than competitors
## Section 2.3 - The Market System
Two key groups participate in the modern economy:
*Households* provide the factors of production: labor, capital, natural resources, and other ways to make products
- Households receive payments for these factors by selling them to firms in **factor markets**
*Firms* supply goods and services to **product markets**, households buy these products from the firms

#### Four Factors of Production
- Labor
- Capital
- Natural Resources
- Entrepreneur - operates a business
	- *Entrepreneurial ability* is the ability to bring together the other factors of production to successfully produce and sell goods and services
#### Circular-flow diagram

- Leaves out government, financial system, and foreign buyers and sellers of goods

- The best entrepreneurs create products that consumers never even knew they wanted
	- “If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.” - Henry Ford
- Government policies encouraging entrepreneurship are likely to increase economic growth and raise standards of living.

### The legal basis of a successful market system
#### Protection of private property
- When criminals can take wages/profits, households and firms have little incentive to work hard
- **Property rights**: rights to the exclusive use of their property including buying and selling
- Enforcement of contracts and property rights are important for transactions across time to occur.
