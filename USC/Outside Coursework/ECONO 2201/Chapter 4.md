## Economic Efficiency
#### Consumer and Producer surplus
**Consumer surplus** - difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price the consumer ends up paying
- Area below demand curve and above the market price

**Producer surplus** - difference between the lowest price a firm would be willing to accept and the actual price it receives
- Area above the supply curve and below the market price

Both measure the net benefit to consumers and producers from participating in a market rather than the total benefit

Economic Surplus = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus

#### How Much Output is Efficient?
Economic efficiency has 2 characteristics:
1. A market is efficient when MB = MC and no other trades take place
2. Consumer and Producer surplus are maximized

At the competitive equilibrium price, economic efficiency is reached

When price increases, producer surplus increases and consumer surplus goes down, the remaining is deadweight loss

## Government Price Setting
#### Price Ceilings and Price Floors
**Price ceiling** - Legally determined maximum price. Price ceiling is set below the market equilibrium price.
- Increases consumer surplus
- Rent Control
- Results in shortage due to increased demand

**Price floor** - Legally determined minimum price. set above the market equilibrium price
- Increases producer surplus
- Minimum Wage
- Results in a surplus or excess supply due to less demand

## Taxes
Without a tax, market equilibrium occurs at equilibrium

After taxes, supply curve is shifted to the left, equilibrium price increases and demand decreases, deadweight loss occurs

The vertical difference between the supply curves is the amount of tax per unit

Producers receive a lower price after paying the tax.

- Producer and Consumer surplus both decrease.
	- Both have a tax burden that can be calculated. Use the original equilibrium price to determine each tax burden
- Total tax revenue is Tax x Quantity
