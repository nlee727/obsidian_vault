## Groups
A group $G$ is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $\cdot$ satisfying
- Associative law
- An identity $e$ in $G$, $ea=ae=a$ $\forall a \in G$
    - $e$ is unique
- $\exists$ inverses $a$ $in$ $G$, $\exists b \in G$ with $ab=ba=e$
    - inverses are unique

#### Basic Examples
1. $X$ non-empty set
$$
sym(x) = \{ f:x\to x| \text{f is 1-1}, {\text{f is onto}} \}
$$
binary operator in compositions of functions 
2. Matrix multiplication
#### Definition
Subgroup: H is a subgroup of G if $H \subseteq G$ and $H$ is a group under the same binary operator
$H \subseteq G$ is a subgroup if $H$ nonempty and closed under multiplicative inverses.

#### Definition
G is called **abelian** if $a,b \in G$, $ab=ba$  $\forall a,b \in G$
- Rational numbers under addition
- Read numbers under addition
- Nonzero elements of $\mathbb{R,Q,C}$ under multiplication
- Polynomial coefficients under additions

## Rings
A ring $R$ is a set with 2 binary operations (+,$\cdot$) satisfying
1. (R,+) is an abelian, has identity 0
2. (R,$\cdot$) satisfies associative law and has identity 1
3. $0 \neq 1$
4. Distributive laws $a(b+c)=ab + ac$
#### Examples
1. Integers, Rationals, Reals, Complex are all rings
2. Matrices over all of these are rings
#### Definition
$R$ is called **commutative** if $rs=sr$ $\forall r, s \in R$

If $R$ is a ring, $R[X]$ is polynomial in $R$
$$
\{\sum_{i=0}^n a_{i}x^i | n=1,2,\dots \}
$$
$f(x)$ in $R[X]$, defines a function on $R$ $\alpha \to f(\alpha) = \sum a_{i} \alpha^i$. $R$ is a ring.

More generally, polynomials over n variables, $R[x_{1},\dots,x_{m}]$
#### Definition
$R$ is called a **domain** if $r,s \in R$ nonzero $\implies$ $rs$ nonzero
$R$ is called an **integral domain** if $R$ is a commutative domain
- e.g. $\mathbb{Z,R,Q,C,}\mathbb{Z}[X], \dots$
- Matrices are not a domain

## Fields
$R$ is a field if $R^\#=R$ without $\{0\}$ is an abelian group
e.g. $\mathbb{Q,R,C,Q(x)}$ fields
