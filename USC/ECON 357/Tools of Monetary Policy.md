## Conventional Monetary Policy Tools
### Open Market Operations
Used to be the main tool under limited reserve regime, now its interest on reserve and ONRRP.
- TRAPS will send signals to primary dealers automatically. Dealers will respond with their level of interest, and the fed will fill their orders.
#### Dynamic Open Market Operations
Permanent change in the level of reserve (outright sale/purchase of securities).
- e.g. sell securities and decrease reserves
#### Defensive Open Market Operations
Temporarily changing the level of reserves. Self reversing operation
- Repurchase agreement
    - Fed purchase some securities (increase amount in bank), seller buys them back at some lower price after a short time.
- Matched sale-purchase agreement (reverse repurchase)
    - Fed sells some securities and promises to buy them back at some higher price.
## Discount Policy and the Lender of Last Resort
### Primary Credit
Upper bound of the target rate (sound banks can borrow at that rate)
- Making sure there is not much fluctuation
- Most important for monetary policy
### Secondary Credit
For banks that are more risky. This is when the fed acts as the lender of last resort. Usually 50 bps higher than primary credit.
### Seasonal Credit
For smaller banks active in certain industries/locations who need more liquidity certain months in the year (banks in vacation areas etc).
### Lender of Last Resort
If banks know they can borrow at any point from the federal reserve, it could cause a moral hazard problem.
## Reserve Requirements
A tool the fed doesn't to use that much because it is costly for banks when it changes (makes it hard to plan).
## Interest on Reserve Balances
Interest on Reserve Balances and ONRRP are the main tools used after 2008, since we moved to an ample reserve regime. It makes it hard to use open market operations to increase federal funds rate quickly.
- ONRRP is a facility large institutions can use for that rate
    - Moves with interest on reserve, fed funds rate sits somewhere in between.
- Discount rate is less used since it is above the federal funds rate and is not binding for most banks.
## On the Failure of Conventional Monetary Policy Tools in a Financial Panic
Conventional monetary tools are no helpful anymore, 
- Because we take the zero-lower-bound problem (cant push the interest rate below 0)
- Expected inflation will be virtually constant in the short term.
## Nonconventional Monetary Policy During the Global Financial Crisis
Discount Window Expansion
- There is a stigma where banks would not use it even if it was low
- Term Auction Facility
- New Lending Program

Asset Purchase Programs to lower interest rates 
- Government Sponsored Entities Purchase Program
    - MBS, and other products to target a market
        - Driving MBS price up and decreasing interest rates to help home buyers
- QE2 - Fed purchased long term securities (bringing down short term interest rate and keeping them low for a longer period of time)
- QE3

Negative interest Rates on Banks Deposits
- Encourage banks to lend out deposits they were keeping at the central bank. Doubts on what negative rates on deposits would have.
