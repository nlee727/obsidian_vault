### The Price Stability Goal and the Nominal Anchor
The main goal for central bank is price stability and low inflation. 
We face the time-inconsistency problem - when we have a long term goal that is in conflict of short term goals.
- A way to avoid that is to have a nominal anchor (inflation target).
### Other Goals of Monetary Policy
5 Goals are continually mentioned
1. High employment and output stability
2. Economic Growth
3. Stability of financial markets
4. Interest-rate stability
5. Stability in foreign exchange markets
### Should Price Stability be the main goal?
- Central banks with hierarchical mandates have an inflation target, put price stability first.
- Dual Mandates are aimed to achieve two coequal objectives: price stability and maximum employment (output stability)
## Inflation Targeting
- Institutional commitment to price stability following a public announcement, creating some accountability. Removes pressure from the central bank, historically improved performances
- Creates transparency of strategy
- Reduces the time-inconsistency problem
##### Disadvantages
- Many countries have not been able to hit the target inflation
- Rigidity can be potentially solved with an intermediate rate causing too much fluctuation for output.
- Short term pain for long term gain
## Fed Just do it approach
Low and stable inflation, maximum employment
