### The Price Stability Goal and the Nominal Anchor
The main goal for central bank is price stability and low inflation. 
We face the time-inconsistency problem - when we have a long term goal that is in conflict of short term goals.
- A way to avoid that is to have a nominal anchor (inflation target).
### Other Goals of Monetary Policy
5 Goals are continually mentioned
1. High employment and output stability
2. Economic Growth
3. Stability of financial markets
4. Interest-rate stability
5. Stability in foreign exchange markets
### Should Price Stability be the main goal?
- Central banks with hierarchical mandates have an inflation target, put price stability first.
- Dual Mandates are aimed to achieve two coequal objectives: price stability and maximum employment (output stability)
## Inflation Targeting
- Institutional commitment to price stability following a public announcement, creating some accountability. Removes pressure from the central bank, historically improved performances
- Creates transparency of strategy
- Reduces the time-inconsistency problem
##### Disadvantages
- Many countries have not been able to hit the target inflation
- Rigidity can be potentially solved with an intermediate rate causing too much fluctuation for output.
- Short term pain for long term gain
## Fed Just do it approach
Low and stable inflation, maximum employment
## Advocacy of Inflation Targeting
Because it sets an average, past inflation can allow for greater rates in the future if the past was below 2%
## Implications
What should be the correct level of the target inflation, however the problem with changing the inflation target will change expectations on inflation targets which could affect contracts today.
## Lessons from the Financial Crisis
- It could have a worse effect than previously thought
- Zero lower bound can be a serious problem, central bank loses its conventional monetary policy (nonconventional or fiscal policy)
- Pricy and output stability does not ensure financial stability
    - People underestimate the amount of risk during periods of stability, which could cause a crisis
## Should Central Banks Respond to Bubbles?
- Asset deviates significantly from its fundamental value
    - Can/Should the fed prevent it
#### Credit-Driven Bubbles
Increase in asset prices due to easy credit availability. Price of an asset increases because investment and borrowing is easy. Lending activity will increase (because higher levels of collateral) spiraling up.
#### Bubbles driven by irrational exuberance
Self-fulfilling prophecy, also a spiral
#### Greenspan
No (lean and clean). If a credit-driven bubble bursts, lending activity goes down and creates a new spiral on the other side, causing a recession and decreased demand.
- Greenspan says they should just react, because they are impossible to identify
    - Credit-driven bubbles are easier to identify because lending can be tracked with prices
- If it is irrational exuberance, increasing interest rates will not really have an effect on those assets.
- Monetary policy may affect non-bubble assets more (blunt instrument)
- Would be harmful to the economy, lowering employment, growth, etc.
- We can clean up after with an aggressive expansionary policy to manage the effect.
    - Cleaning after a credit-driven bubble is much harder so fed will lean against those. Irrational exuberance is harder to identify but easier to clean up.
#### Monetary Policy
If the fed believes there is a sector being affected by credit-driven bubble, they can use monetary policy (could increase interest rate if its caused by lots of loans)
#### Macroprudential policy
Regulatory policies to prevent credit institutions on taking on too much risk. Monitoring, stress testing. 
## Tactics: Choosing the Policy Instrument
Tools are used to influence policy instruments.
- Forward Guidance: Like the fed changing long term rates to show that they will have rates stay low e.g. changing expectations
## Criteria for Choosing the Instrument
Both the effect on Reserves and federal funds rate are observable
- There is a delay in reporting reserve levels
Controllability - Does not have absolute control over reserve because of the movements in and out of currency from individual business
- How effective are these on monetary policy? We now target the federal funds rate
## Tactics: Taylor Rule
We have decided that we want to target FF rate. We must answer what that rate must be.
Federal funds rate target = inflation rate + equilibrium real fed funds rate + 1/2(inflation gap) + 1/2(output gap)

$$
i_{ff}=\pi+2+\frac{1}{2}(\pi-\pi^T)+\frac{1}{2}(y-y^P)
$$
1% increase in inflation -> increase fed funds by 1.5%. Increasing the real rate to decrease the level of borrowing and spending, decreasing demand and decreasing inflation.
- To tell whether unemployment is high or low, compare it to the natural level of unemployment. inverse relationship between unemployment and output.

#### NAIRU - natural rate of unemployment
- where labor market will not have an effect on inflation
- When unemployment is high, workers have less bargaining power and their wages go down meaning inflation goes down
### Reasons to deviate from taylor rule
1. Big lag from when monetary policy is implemented and when it becomes effective, so the fed funds needs to be more forward looking
2. We dont exactly know what the natural rate of unemployment is and potential output. Monetary policy is hard when the unemployment rate is close to the natural rate
3. Policy makers may put a higher priority on unemployment or inflation at specific times.
