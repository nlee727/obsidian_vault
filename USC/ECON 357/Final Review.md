## Chapter 1
Not much just review quickly
## Chapter 2:
Go over the slides
- Different players, financial players, intermediaries, different markets
- Financial Instruments - know the definitions of money market and capital market instruments
    - Eurodollars/Eurobonds
The role of financial intermediaries
Regulation - This is a highly regulated industry because of asymmetric information
## Chapter 3
Money - definition, role
- Evolution of payment system
- How to measure it using M1 and M2
## Chapter 4
Interest rate and its measures
### YTM
- Given a fixed income security, find the YTM without excel or write an equation
Bonds are $1000 face value
If YTM and coupon rate are equal, price = face value
- How to find price from YTM
### Return
$$
\text{RET}=\frac{c}{p_{t}}+\frac{{p_{t+1}-p_{t}}}{p_{t}}
$$
What would be the capital gain/loss, will it be higher/lower than YTM
Effect of change in interest rate in the return with shorter term vs higher term bonds
Nominal real rate 

## Chapter 5
Tried to model interest rate using a supply and demand curve (using price on the y axis)
### Determinants of Demand:
Wealth, Expected Return (relative to other assets), Risk (relative to other investment opportunities), expected inflation (expected real interest rate)

Under a recession/expansion what will happen to the graph

### Market for Money
Money supply vs Money demand
$$
M^d=PL(i,Y)
    $$
Portfolio selection issue, what is the demand for interest bearing assets
- Central bank can respond to any change and determine money supply

## Chapter 6
### Risk Structure of Interest Rate
Default risk, liquidity risk, tax consideration
Start at equilibrium, and look at the spread compared with treasuries.

### Term Spread
Facts about bonds with different maturities (definitely a question)
- Expectation theory, Preferred Habitat, Segmented Market, Liquidity Premium
For example - assume expectation theory, given a return what should a return on a 3 year bond be (do not use average approximation)
$$
(1+i)^n=(1+r_{1})(1+E(r_{2}))\dots(1+E(r_{n}))
$$
Given the shape of a yield curve, what does it say about expected future interest rates.
- For example, flat yield curve shows they will decrease in the future 
## Chapter 7
Gordon Growth model, you need to calculate the present value of the stock

Efficient market hypothesis is a result of rational expectations

## Chapter 8
The 8 facts on why the market looks the way it does.
- The effect of economies of scale
Main theme is economies of scale and moral hazard
- How they help to solve adverse selection and moral hazard
- Why regulation
- What is the problem in low income countries (low collateral)

You need to pay for information but it brings in the free rider problem, so the producer of information cannot get all the benefit (so financial intermediaries produce private information)

## Chapter 9
Started with the balance sheet of Banks
- Transactions (how they affect balance sheet of banks)
Bank management, liability management, liquidity management, 
- Look at outflow of deposits, when does a bank go into a liquidity problem
Given a balance sheet of a bank, how much outflow can the bank tolerate, what actions can the bank take, what is the easiest/hardest option.
- What is the cost of ensuring against too much outflow (more liquid assets usually means lower return)
Capital Adequacy to remain solvent.
- There is a tradeoff with return on equity
- What is equity multiplier, how can a bank change capital equity and the EQ multiplier
    - What do banks do during a recession (changing liquidity given the economic situation)
Managing risk
- Benefits of loan commitment and credit rationing, role of collateral
- Make sure to explain gap analysis, duration analysis
Off balance sheet activities (how do these expose the bank to risk)

## Chapter 13
How prominent the fed is, how they are elected
- How are the directors of each federal bank is elected
- Slides are enough
## Chapter 14
Nonbank public - who is involved, what is the effect of the balance sheet on these
What if there is an open market operation
Main assets and liabilities of the fed, banking system
Class and Assignment examples

Relationship between monetary base and money supply
True money multiplier
- Currency holding ratio, excess reserve what will happen to money supply

Similar to the last assignment
What will happen to the FF rate
- Consider what reserve regime we are in
- Graph in a way that is reasonable
What are the actions the fed would take given a goal and a equilibrium 

## Chapter 15
Open Market Operation
- Defensive vs Dynamic operations
Review
## Chapter 16
Goals of monetary policy, maximum employment
Interest rate stability, stability of markets, exchange rate stability all related to growth

What are the benefits/tradeoffs for inflation targeting (dual mandate)
Should the fed identify bubbles

Monetary Aggregates (the fed cannot control both at the same time) since demand is constantly moving back and fourth

Taylor rule - not completely following because of lag and forward looking
## Chapter 17
The only thing you are responsible for is 
The effect on long term exchange rate given purchasing power parity (preferences, tariffs, productivity, anything that changes relative price level)

Have an idea of purchasing power parity and the effect of each of the rows with exchange rate
- Up to slide 7
- If price level decreases in a country, the currency appreciates
- Markets in equilibrium (no arbitrage/ incentive to buy in one place and sell in another)
