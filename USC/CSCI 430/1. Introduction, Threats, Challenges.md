### Security Properties
- C (Confidentiality)
    - Data secrecy - Keep data secret from unauthorized subjects
    - privacy - individuals control who can access their information
- I (Integrity)
    - Authenticity
    - Data integrity - Keep data from being modified
    - System integrity - Keep systems functioning as intended
- A (Availability)
    - Keep the system running and responsive to legitimate clients
#### Orthogonal Aspects
- Policy
    - Deciding what CIA mean in a given context.
        - Social App
        -  C - Only users can access their own data so every account is private
        - I - All data is not changed, check every day
        - A - Pay for protection service like cloudflare
- Mechanism
    - Implementing the policy
    - Firewalls, file system access controls, authentication mechanisms, VPN, etc.

### Security Goals
- Attack prevention
    - Make it impossible for the attack to succeed
- Attack Detection
    - Low false positives, false negatives and detection delay
    - False positive - system detects, but the attack did not occur
    - false negative is when the attack is missed by the system

## Threats
#### Breaking into my computer
- Hackers
    - Exploit a vulnerability
    - Break a password or sniff off the network
    - Replay a valid answer to a challenge to gain access
    - Use social engineering
    - Impersonate someone i trust
- Viruses and worms
    - Automated exploit
#### Attacking my computer
- Denial of service attacks
    - disrupt service by sending a lot of bogus information

#### Stealing my information
- From my computer or from communication
- I will use cryptography
    - There are many ways to break ciphers
    - There are many ways to divulge partial information
        - See who you are communicating to infers something
- I would like to hide who I am talking to

#### Using my machine to attack others
- E-mail virus
- worms
- DOS attacks
- Spam, phishing

#### Damaging my hardware or data
- Prevent break-ins
- Use Cryptography to detect tampering
- Must replicate data to recover from tampering
- DOS attacks and worms can sometimes damage computers

## Challenges
- Your security frequently depends on others
    - Tragedy of Commons
        - Peoples benefit depends on the actions of others, so if everyone acts selfishly they all lose
        - You must have some rules 
- So a good solution must 
    - Handle the problem to a great extent
    - Handle future variations of the problem
    - Be inexpensive
    - Have economic incentive
    - Require a few deployment points
    - Require non-specific deployment points
- Often there is scarce attack data

- Risk analysis vs Management tradeoff
