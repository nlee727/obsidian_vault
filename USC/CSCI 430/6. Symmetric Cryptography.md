### Symmetric Encryption
Scramble messages between Alice and Bob so others who see the messages cannot make sense of them

##### Secret Algorithm
Alice could give a message covertly "meet at the old place"
- Doesn't work at scale or for arbitrary messages
##### Secret mapping of a message
Bob has to know this offline
- Secret algorithms can be broken by bad guys

- Good cryptography assumes knowledge of algorithm by anyone, secret lies in a **key**

### Substitution
##### Monoalphabetic 
Each character is replaced w/ another character
- Ceasar's cipher - each letter is shifted by 3
- Keep mapping of symbols into other symbols
- Drawback: frequency stays the same and can be used to break the cipher
##### Homophonic
Each character is replaced with a character chosen randomly from a subset
- Ciphertext alphabet must be larger than plaintext alphabet - replace letters by two-digit numbers
- Number of symbols in the subset depend on the frequency of the given letter in the plaintext
- Resulting ciphertext has all symbols with same frequency
##### Polygram 
Each sequence of characters of length n is replaced with another sequence of characters of length n
- Like monoalphabetic cipher but works on n-grams
##### Polyalphabetic
Many monoalphabetic ciphers are used sequentially
- First mapping is used for the first letter, second for the second
- XOR is a polyalphabetic cipher in binary domain
