##### Relationships
- Customer/provider - USC is small in the context of providing internet to everyone, so they pay to send traffic to Centurylink to reach out to the internet
- Peer-to-peer - 2 networks that are relatively similar size who want to peer into the other. Scientists at both colleges want to be able to exchange traffic. Routers are in the same physical location and they exchange traffic for free but within their own addresses.
