Goal: protect private communication in the public world
- assume everyone can hear messages

#### Uses
- Authentication
    - Bob should be able to verify that Alice has created the message
- Integrity
    - Bob should be able to verify that the message has not been modified
- Non-repudiation
    - Alice cannot deny that she sent the message
- More

#### Types of Cryptographic Functions
- One way has functions: no key
    - Should produce unique, unpredictable output
    - Plaintext -> fingerprint
    - Usually for integrity
- Symmetric: one (shared) key
    - Usually for confidentiality
    - Plaintext -> cyphertext
- Asymmetric Crypto: two keys
    - Confidentiality and authenticity
    - Alice has a public and private key
    - Everyone knows the public key
    - Encrypt with one and decrypt with the other
    - Plaintext -> cyphertext

### Attacks on Cryptography
- Say Eve and Mallory are the enemies
    - Eve can only observe but not interact
    - Mallory can insert or modify messages
- For one-way hash:
    - Alter the message without altering its fingerprint
    - Brute-force attack
- For symmetric/asymmetric crypto:
    - Either learn the keys or learn plaintext from cyphertext
    - Cyphertext-only attack, known-plaintext attack, chosen-plaintext attack
    - Man in the middle attack
    - Brute-force attack

#### Cyphertext-Only
- Eve can gather and analyze cyphertext to learn decryption key
- How does Eve know she got the right key?
    - Must be able to recognize the plaintext or test it
- Eve has to have enough cyphertext to exploit regularities

#### Known-Plaintext
- Eve can learn decryption key by observing many cyphertexts for known messages
- How does Eve learn about plaintext input?
    - Could be a well-known public protocol
#### Chosen-Plaintext
- Mallory can feed chosen messages M into encryption algorithm and look at resulting cyphertexts C
    - Learn either decryption key or messages M that produce C
#### Man-In-The-Middle
- Mallory can substitute/modify messages for a different meaning or scramble them
- Mallory can drop and replay messages to Alice, Bob or the third party

#### Brute-Force
- On one-way hash
    - Eve tries every possible input into the has algorithm to find inputs which produce the same output
- On crypto:
    - Eve has caught a cyphertext and will try every possible key to try to decrypt it
- Brute force attacks can be made infinitely hard by choosing a large keyspace (crypto) or large output size (hash)

### One-Way Hash Functions
- Take variable length input M and produce fixed length output
$$h=H(M)$$
- One way hash function is public
- One-way hash function requirements
    - M can be any size
    - h is always fixed size
    - Given M it is very east to produce h
    - Given h it is very hard to compute M (one way property)
    - Given M is is hard to find M' such that H(M)=H(M') (weak collision resistance)
        - Different from M but has the same hash
        - Assurance that the sender sent M
    - Hard to find 2 random messages M1 and M2 such that H(M1) = H(M2) (strong collision resistance)
        - Only brute force, no computationally efficient way to do so
- Divide M into blocks, generate hash value iteratively
- Hash value of the whole message is obtained in the last step
##### Uses
- Storing hashed password info
- Message integrity
    - Use message M and shared secret S, runt this through hash function and produce MIC = secure hash
    - Send only M and MIC
    - Why do we need a shared secret?
- Message fingerprint
    - Hash the files to detect tampering
    - Works for download security too
- Signing message hash instead of the whole message is faster

#### Standard Hash Algorithms
SHA-1
SHA-2 
SHA- 3
- Completely different algorithm
