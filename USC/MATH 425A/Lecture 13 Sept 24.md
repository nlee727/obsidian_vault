### Theorem 2.40
Every k-cell is compact
#### Recall
A set K is compact in a metric space (X,d) if every open covering of K admits a finite subcovering.

### Theorem 2.41
If $E \in \mathbb{R}^k$ satisfies any one of these conditions, it satisfies all 3
1. $E$ is closed and bounded
2. $E$ is compact
3. Every infinite subset of $E$ having a limit point within $E$.
##### Notes
- Heine-borel theorem relates 1 and 2
- 2 and 3 are true together in any metric space
- There are some metric spaces where being closed and bounded is not the same as being compact such as $\mathbb{Q}$ or certain spaces of functions
