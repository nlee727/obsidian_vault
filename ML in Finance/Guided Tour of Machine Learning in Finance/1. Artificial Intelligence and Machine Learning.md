### Quantitative Trading (action)
#### Optimal trade execution
- Profit-maximizing trade execution
#### Quantitative trading strategies
- Earning prediction (regression)
    - Earnings, Stocks, Liquidity
- Algorithmic trading
- Optimal market making

### Perception: Forecasting tasks
- Security price predictions - SL/UL
- Corporation actors action prediction (dividends, mergers, defaults) - SL/UL/RL
- Individual actors action prediction (loan defaults, fraud, AML) - SL/UL/RL
### Perception: Valuation tasks
- Asset valuation - SL/UL
- Derivatives valuation - SL/UL/RL

- Perception tasks commonly involve Reinforcement learning because expectations regarding the future are sometimes embedded in perception of today's environment.
### Action: Trading and asset management
- Optimal execution of brokerage trading - SL/UL/RL
- Optimal strategies for day trading - SL/UL/RL
- Active Portfolio management - SL/UL/RL
### Action: Decision making in banking
- Loan approvals - SL/UL/RL, Bayesian networks
- Credit and operational risk management - SL/UL/RL, Bayesian networks
- Decision making in compliance analytics (fraud) - SL/UL/RL, Bayesian networks

### Key Differences with ML in Finance
- As most financial data are non-stationary, collecting more data, even when possible, is not always helpful
- Financial data are typically quite noisy - true signals are unobservable
- RL tasks have high-dimensional state-action space and high uncertainty
- Interpretability of results is often required
